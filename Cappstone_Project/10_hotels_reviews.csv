1,"Very good hotel, nice service we will plan next vacation also with the family and friends. Staff was very friendly, food was hygienic and tasty. I got service in midnight for food they really care for us.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
2,"Far away from the over crowded Calangute and Baga, Whispering Palms in Candolim has the perfect location with an access gate within hotel to the non commercial part of Candolim beach. Initially I had a concern with the allotted room in block 1, which was a very small but pool facing and quick access to restaurant and activity area. However the pool facing rooms could turn out to be disturbing during private event nights and evenings with in house DJ. Even the gallery was wet due to rainwater dripping in. Had to spend a night here, but was very happy with Mr. Govind Singh, who understood our concern and immediately considered to provide an upgrade in their suite rooms the next day for the balance 3 nights. The garden facing rooms were much more spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was OK, not great. The taste and variety has a lot of scope for improvement. The spread contained usual Indian and continental dishes. Also at times gets more crowded due to small service area. Mid sized pool. Very small size childrens activity area. Local people managing the taxi stand right outside the hotel are very rude and expensive. One can walk down 20 meters on main road to avail cab, bikes, car facilities at slightly lesser price. Very close, walking distance to all the good restaurants and pubs to enjoy live music and food in the evening.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
3,Very close to Candolim beach. Nice food and buffet. Swimming pool is good and big.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

13,Overall very Bed experience with whispering palm as food was horrible and the dinner was worst ever we have a experience of food of whispering palm. All though location was good but it is not worth to spend 6000 to 7000 per day. It is worth for only 1000 to 2000 per day a per facility and food quality of the whispering palm,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
14,The location is very good... Pool side is amazing. Food is mouthwatering.. I suggest to go for Breakfast and one meal deal as the food here is very nice. The hotel staff is very nice and cooperative.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
15,First time me and my family booked a room through this make my trip app. Location of hotel is good nearest to beach ... But the service and hospitality was very bad. They were very much concern about non indians. Didn't offer a welcome drink. It was very much unwelcome behaviour. Few of our bags were carried by us only. Most important they didn't give us free WiFi. Said the line is under repair. Not bothered to sort out the issue in any other way. I wont go to that resort again.,2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

The only issue we had was that the springs of the mattress where wobbly and sleep was not so comfortable. But thanks to the great service from the housekeeping dept . They had an alternative. For beach lovers, a perfect place, not crowded and just 2 mins walk fro the hotel.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

35,"Had a comfortable stay with family. Food was tasty and the spread was good. Only concern is the parking. There are very few parking slots on their property. Even though it's called beach resort the hotel is far from beach, but at a walkable distance. So, don't expect beach view rooms.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
36,"Hotel is not maintaining 4 star quality and more focused on foreigners. We could get better hotels in the price we paid. They have given us a complimentary Jacuzzi which was just a step with 2- 3 holes in swimming pool. The only good thing is 'Tom', a wonderful piano player who is always full of positive energy.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
37,"The rooms are good, however the there is some what delay in the service, like food service, cleaning service.

I personally believe the hotel ia slightly overpriced but this is acceptable if you are visiting Goa.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

49,"It was 5-7 minutes walk from beach, not well maintained property. Staff was not proactive.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
50,I have paid for the balcony room but they have not given me the same as they have no balcony rooms left with them. That's not my mistake. They have charged me for the balcony room.,1,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
51,"There was absolutely no safety standards: no thermal screening, no one wearing mask, no protocols for swimming pool, locker not working (for safety of money, we had to keep money with manager mr iyer, thereby openly disclosing the amount publicly in front of all staff, buffet breakfast was being taken by all residents without mask and no one bothering about corona. Its 5 star rating (as put up by make my trip) must be immediately taken off because it is misleading to all future bookings with high expectations. Breakfast horrible, tomato soup made out of tomato ketchup, fresh fruit juice of both water melon & pineapple. Just have it once, to know what it is and how does it become frothy. No presentation skills. Staff misbehaved. And one of the key of 313 was misplaced and when we paid 2000- for lost key, we asked for pre-written rule about it and they couldnt produce. Then, i gave them address of delhi to courier me the lock that they are replacing and i would pay the courier amount too. No such action taken so far by the hotel. I advise all future family members to avoid going to this hotel, which claims to have 5 star facilities, without being able to show even a 4 star rating awarded to it by goa tourism. I would ask for a complete refund of the entire booking amount from make my trip. One day was completely wasted in changing room, as the locker wasnt working. I have proof and pics of everything that i have said so far.",1,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
52,"I had been to this resort before and I liked the ambience, food and location. Hence when I was travelling with family, I was skeptical of a new place. As it turned out, the experience was amazing and the staff was cooperative as well. Just a suggestion to the hotel, have some loyalty cards for regular customers",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
53,"I booked 3 rooms of which, 2 rooms were booked in which extra bedding was added and paid but wasnt provided. Also no extra water bottle for thoes 2 rooms. Also the hair dryer for 2 rooms were not working and so had to use from the 3rd room for everybody.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

83,"The proximity of the hotel is really amazing it's just right next to the beach (walking distance 1 min). Their room service, food, cleanings everything is good except that due to their check in time they fail to support early check in. Especially if you are travelling with infant you have to be prepared with other plans. Their baby/ toddler food is great and my son just loved their khichdi.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
84,"We stayed here for 5 nights in end May to celebrate 25 years together. Location is excellent - 3 minutes from Sinquerim beach, many nearby eating places. We got a nice cosy room, very clean, good air-conditioner with working remote, average Wi-Fi quality. The place has very frequent power breakdowns. They have a genset which takes a while to switch on. One night there was an outage of 45 mts. We had some mosquitoes and they provided us a Good Knight device to resolve the issue. The bathroom is small / cramped but well appointed. Shower cubicle is open and wets the floor inside bathroom-design problem. The mattress is too soft and caused us back pain which housekeeping rectified by provided some extra foam mattresses. Note to management : A deluxe resort should have deluxe mattresses - firm & comfy. Service : friendly and excellent. Well trained staff. Pool - Lovely. Restaurant - excellent, helm ed by Chef Bapi Roy. Good quality tasty food and well planned menus, we had the buffet lunch once and the buffet dinner once. A sumptuous buffet breakfast is provided everyday. Quality & Strength of Tea can improve - NTM. Restaurant has both indoor (with AC) as well as outdoor sections. Some karaoke entertainment on some evenings along with a pool table. Food Prices - expensive - many people get food from outside because of this. NTM : Please understand the price elasticity of demand, if prices are reasonable, your sales will increase. Check-in/out: It took us 2 hours to check in as MMT had not sent the booking to the hotel. During checkout the only payment machine was not working, so we had to pay cash. So these issues left a bad taste in the mouth in an otherwise good experience and a very good place to stay. Can go from good to great with a little effort.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
85,"Very bad experience for us in this resort, reception staff very rude, we book suite room in this resort, my cousin brother stayed another hotel, when he come to meet me, hotel staff asking me out side person not allowed in this resort, i ask i will pay ammount with id proof for stay period, i say how much you want, but they ask not allowed, very bad staff, room not clean everyday, when you ask then they came, i was book suite room, small room, very bad experience, same day same breakfast, no many options of food, buffet lunch dinner no more items same day same item, very very very very very very very bad resort with staff, food etc",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
86,Awesome experience with the family,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
87,"When I entered the resort, my morale was low. I was travelling with my spouse and 9 year old girl. First impression was that my daughter did not liked the resort and she was not excited. But as the day progressed the opinion changed completely. We stayed for 3 days in Whispering Palm and in these 3 days they made us a complete fan of their resort. Be it service, staff, facilities, courtesy: This resort scores full points in every aspect. We have stayed in many expensive hotels in Goa, but this resort beats them all. Location is just next to beach. Through out the day they try to engage guests through various recreational activities. I booked 3 days whispering and next 3 days another 5* hotel. My daughter liked this place so much that she just not wanted to shift to the other 5* and wanted to cancel that booking and rebook in this resort again. In short thanks Whispering Palm for making the stay memorable. We are your permanent guests in Goa for years to come.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
88,"The property enjoys a central location, yet the garden facing rooms are well designed to provide privacy. The breakfast is delicious. However, the parking facility is a chaos where you sometimes need to spend 10 minutes to take your car out. Wifi coverage is also poor. Barring these two issues, everything else was good.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
89,Everything was too good... Enjoyable stay... Good food.. Good culture.. Easy taxi service.. Cooperative staff... Overall 100%... I will be happy to come here again and suggest my friends also.. Thanks hotel staff for making our stay very comfortable.. Music.. Dance.. Masti..,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
90,"This is a nice little hotel with comfortable rooms and facilities. The pool does not offer much privacy as it is very close to the rooms. The common areas are tightly squeezed in between the rooms. The hotel staff was very helpful, and focused on hospitality. The gym was dingy and small with water leakage issues - best avoided. For those who are looking for a mid range comfort, this hotel is a good choice.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

96,"It is the staff who truly reflect the warmth of a service industry like hotel. I give full points to the staff who served with smile and humility. Food was excellent. I need to change the room because it was quite stuffy due to moisture on the walls. Transport service was nice and on time. The hotel person waa waiting for us at the airport with our name displayed. The hotel provided live as well as DJ entertainment. We were quite at ease. One suggestion which I would like to make: the prices of laundary were very steep, Rs.150 for the one trouser etc. Because of sea and sand, you tend to wet so many clothes and hotel policy does not allow to hang clothes outside!",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

105,Food was ok. Safety is an issue. I found a insect in my room!,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
106,"We were quite disappointed as the room given to us was not having the view which we were expecting. We had to ask for another room. Room was fine but was not in very good condition especially the bathroom. Also, some renovation work was going on which was quite disturbing. Overall, I didn't feel the value for the money we paid for this hotel. Almost everything was paid except swimming pool and Jacuzzi once.",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
107,The hotel is very well situated close to many beaches in North Goa. This is not a 4 star but a good enough stay that would make your experience pleasant. They had a very good spread of food. If you are a vegetarian you would enjoy the food as there are a lot of options. The pick up from airport was on time. They also allowed me extend the check out time by an hour.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

111,"ropertyArshi Ahmed .  . Jun 30, 2018It is definitely not a 4 star property. The location is very close to the beach. Food was good. We were upgraded to suite rooms which were good. It is a small property and is not really a resort. If you are looking for places to visit nearby then choose this property but if you are looking for a peaceful holiday then this is not a place for you. We were very disappointed by the taxi services outside the resort as they were charging exorbitant money for very short distances.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
112,This is a good property at a good location near to Beach with a good swimming pool and nice food but the room that they gave us was simply pathetic a small cornered room I mean that should not be on their list. Room no 106. Although staff was polite and attentive but even after multiple attempts nobody came to clean our room. So another disappointment althogh they changed our room which made me give them 3 stars. So I would say a hotel a good location with great food but quite average rooms.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
113,"Pros: 1. The location and proximity to Beach, Beach is not that crowded compared to it's vicinity like Calangute and Baga. Flipside, no shacks. 2. Very good swimming pool. 3. Pool side Bar, restaurant and Buffet with DJ nights, Karaoke nights etc. 4. Good chefs, very helpful if you have a young kid(under 3) who require special food. 5. Balcony in rooms. Bigger rooms not allocated(or only allocated to foreigners/folks booking via their site? Even though booked Studio suites which is the biggest booking available). Cons: 1. Reception staff not that helpful in case of problem situations, Had a power cut for 4 hrs on a extremely hot morning and they wouldn't even help with a timeline on when the problem will be fixed nor any explanation on the problem or why there is no generator working. Limited Bar menu and Lunch/Dinner buffet. 3. Very Small suite rooms ( called suite though)",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
114,Near by Beach gift of nature in your Resort very well Worth to stay with you,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
115,"The breakfast gets an average as it was just not good. I hoped a lot more from the breakfast in terms of quality and variety but was disappointed to see the buffet. Also, was hoping for a pool facing balcony room as shown in pictures. Unfortunately was allotted something else.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
116,The hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. I really like the food.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
117,Excellent stay. Value for money. Quality food. Excellent service.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

119,Good stay overall enjoyed the evening event and food was too good !! Nice place to relax and enjoy the weekend peacefully !! Nearby to all shopping places and very close by to beach it's just five minutes walk from the resort !!,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
120,"Stayed with my wife for 3 nights, the property is very close to beach. The staff and food was great. The prices are very reasonable, we had booked balcony room which was a bit small but well maintained. Swimming pool was also cleaned on daily basis.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
121,"One of the best hotels in Candolim, just 5mins away from the beach ...
Very well maintained hotel with nice rooms & facilities
Excellent service from hotel staff, very nice buffet for breakfast ..
Slightly higher rates but overall a very nice place to be in Goa",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
122,"as Paul . Family Traveller . Oct 29, 2017Can’t blame the hotel rather will blame MMT for the booking as was not at all what I thought. It’s very costly and you have many better options in that price. The pictures also are something which is made up I feel.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
123,"This was my family’s first trip after having a little one after the whole lock down last year. The stay at whispering palms was decent. Saying that, there’s room for improvement. The pool was clean and the life guard insisted on shower before entering, which was good. We did not eat much at the hotel so cannot review about the taste. The staff was friendly, but can’t say much about service. Wanted to get my room cleaned after a day and they finally did after two days. Shout-out to the welcome violin musician who was the best.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
124,"hijit Banerjee . Couple Traveller . Feb 01, 2021Decent facilities and good location at reasonable price. But definitely not 4-star. Wi-fi not working. No shower door in bathroom, so floor gets completely wet. Staff very good.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
125,This property is not on the category of 4 star old property with old Furnture. Nothing great except the staff. Specially Jassy small swimming pool. Rooms are ok size but with old furniture and bathroom are smaller size. If you looking for beach then it take 10 minutes to reach but you can swim theirs too.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
126,"Happened to be visiting Goa during a summery, off season month. It was impressed with the hotel location - minutes from Candolim beach, courteous and cooperative staff. Well designed compact rooms, nice poolside arrangement. I would recommend to all for a 3-day trip!",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
127,"It was a pleasurable experience staying in this property. The hospitality of the staff is commendable. In terms of food, they have a very good menu. They made our stay memorable and romantic. A must recommended resort!!",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
128,Very good services,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
129,The hotel justifies its price and brand due to it safety standards and precautions that are being followed. Starting from entry till the exit i couldn't find anything to complain regarding the safety procedures.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
130,Hotel offers neat and clean rooms with friendly staff. Moreover the food and variety on offer is good. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity and car/ bike rentals available just outside the hotel. The beach is 5 minutes walk. Thus making a pleasurable stay overall. The only reservation one can make is the hotel restaurant pricing which seems high. However one can get enough options nearby.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
131,Although it's a small resort but food was really good.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
132,"I was with my family, location was adjacent to Beach but not in the Beach. It should have been made clear in the website whereas they bluffed that hotel is Beach facing and charged exorbitant rates not Worth for",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
133,The room we were shown in make my trip didn't match with the actual room given. Tv wasn't working. View wasn't good from the balcony. It didn't feel like a 4 star property at all. Breakfast was same for all 3 days. Nothing was changed apart from 1-2 dishes in the whole buffet.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
134,"Room service is very poor and less amenities.
They have to improve in service and basic skills for staff, they even don't know how to attend the guest. No proper information regarding the property and other services.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
135,"The hotel was adequate and the room was basic. The MMT booking confirmation says that check out is 12, when it is actually 11. The result was I was made to feel like the staff was doing me a favor. If you want a sun bed you need to be up very early.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
136,"First, its not at all on beach and so the name should be only WHISPERING PALMS HOTEL or RESORT. Rooms were not at all upto mark. ambience was pathetic. AC didnt work for all 3 days. gutter smell was coming in bathroom probably because of plumbing problem. hot water for bath sometimes came sometimes not. food was good.",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
137,"operty at allShweta Sood . Couple Traveller . Aug 18, 2019I wish, we would have chosen some other hotel! Pros- Great location, good access to the beach. Cons - The feel and vibe of the hotel, seems very old, not grand at all, pool and lounge was very basic, Rooms were basic, breakfast was ok, for playing indoor games they charge money, its good to have engagement of guest, but should not charge, that's not what a good resort offers. I particularly don't have a major issue with the property, but we have stayed in much better and beautiful properties in the past holidays, this resort was very basic and average! Not our Taste, not a 4star hotel vibe!",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
138,Room was ok but room services are poor. Not worth the price which I paid.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

145,"WOW. Awesome Hospitality.
In My 50 Years Of Travel within India & Abroad & having Stayed in 5 * & 7 * Deluxe Resorts, I have Not seen such Awesome Hospitality starting from Reception Staff especially Mr Parmeshwar who Upgraded Me To a Suite. The Resort & Rooms is Simple but has All the Facilities & Amenities That are required. Since Mine was a Suite it was quite Spacious with a couch & Balcony.
Resort has 2 Restaurants, Breeze attached to a Lovely Swimming Pool which & whose Lounges we’re Fully occupied from 7 am by Foreigners where Delicious Buffet Breakfast is served Both Indian & Continental Food. With Live Egg Station is served. The other is Authentic Indian Restaurant which I didn’t visit. Candolim Beach is Only 75/100 Myra away which is very neat & clean with Lots of Shacks with Lounges. If you order something then you can sit for Free on Lounges with Free Wi-do o/wise you have to pay. Lots of Good Restaurants on the main Road with 1 Of The Oldest & Most Famous Fishermen’s Cove Famous For it’s Sea Food Tandoori Fish & Golden Fried Prawns are Yummy. Don’t Miss it.
If you are staying in North Goa then Whispering Palms Beach Resort is the Ultimate Place to Stay.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

157,Good budget stay option near beach,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
158,"Considering the resort is some distance away from the beach, the size of the rooms seemed a bit small for even the discounted rates.
The Facilities are decent though, the restaurant is good and not too expensive.
The space for parking is less though and you might have to park at the taxi stand if you come back late in the night.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

169,All facilities are very nice and also staff are so friendly.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
170,The studio rooms are far too costly compared to the facility given. The rooms were not properly located. But room size was big. Same breakfast every day. The staff were very slow in replying to the customers. They were more concentrating on people who have come with groups rather than others. People come with family get isolated. Need to develop themselves in customer management.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
171,Food quality was very good. Swimming pool was good. Neat and clean resort. Overall experience was very good. Staff was very cooperative.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
172,The hotel should be kept neat and clean at all times and more variety for the menu at the buffet. The Spa was amazing. The food at the buffet was amazing too. The staff and housekeeping were professional.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
173,Close to Candolim beach. Not so far from Baga as well. Better shopping options nearby than in Baga. Breakfast was exquisite. Room was great with balcony opening to a pool side view. Staff were very friendly. Pool was clean and we had fun playing pool Volleyball. Would stay again if I go there.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
174,Pictures have clearly been edited to make the place look better. Food options was extremely limited and quality was very poor.,1,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
175,Rooms are very small and cramped. Whenever the next room guy opens or closes the door you get disturbed. Also no separate rooms for smokers which creates problems for non smokers. On the whole the resort is very small and does not have much indoor recreation. Staff was helpful. Food was good.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
176,"I stayed here with my family. My daughter in 1.5 years old, for her there was no play area. Food taste was not very good. They upgraded my room without any charges but that room is average in size. They charged a lot from customer but their services were not like that. Average hotel with good staffs.",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
177,"We stayed for 3 nights in May and booked the balcony room. I was accompanied by my wife and 5 yr old daughter both of whom love beaches. The room was decent coated on first floor balcony overlooking the pool. View was nice. Room was decent in size. Comfortable bed and mattress. In room facilities were adequate. Pros: Good location.. Easy access to beach. Friendly staff, esp Vinda was very friendly and approachable. Good breakfast spread. Nice location. . Nearby to many restaurants in Candolim. Cons: Air conditioning didn't work well on day 1. Took several calls to get it fixed. Tata sky just worked for 1 hour and went kaput. I missed the IPL final. Not spacious rooms and had a feeling of being cramped for space. No restriction on pool usage. Saw people fully clothed and not taking shower before dipping in. Overall it's a decent stay.. Wouldn't say value for money. There are certainly better options in Candolim.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

183,"The property referred to us was really good, moreover what has been promised by Hotel Authorities in the package was delivered in the best way in a complete form. But one thing to mention is that as the room booked by us was Top of the class room of a Four Star property but the rooms were not up to that standard but still the overall experience at hotel was really awesome. The Hotel Staff was really cooperative and the facilities provided at the hotel was true luxurious and top of the class. The quality & presentation of the food was truly wonderful to activate any one's taste buds. The construction of the property was one of the best in terms of architecture and was well maintained. Whispering Palms really stood up to their name as the property was planted with no. of palm tree that and they use to whisper in the calm environment. One of the best things that we experienced was the lush green forest area that one has to cover while moving from Goa Airport to the hotel & it's mesmerizing.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Good maintenance and food was good.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
185,"Th Hotel is very Near to Candolim Beach. Just 200 mts walking distance. We booked 2 Balcony rooms for my family and my Parents via MMT. Upon reaching hotel they said they have upgraded us to Terrace Rooms. We got 321 & 322 ground floor rooms In Room 321 where me, my wife and my kid were staying, the Bed (Twin Beds) were not in good condition.. I complaint on this and on 2nd day they put an additional mattress over the bed and then it was fine. There was a foul smell outside the rooms. There was a dog continuously returning and lying outside the rooms due to rain, upon asking about it the housekeeping staff said its hotel's dog. But since we had a kid, I had to make him go away every time. There was no mini bar provided in room 321. It was there in 322. My question to the Hotel is why to provide the Terrace Room with a wider balcony, when it's roof is not covered and the guest can not use it since the rains were having repeatedly. What is the use?? There were also mosquitoes in the room. The Food was delicious and of Good Quality in the restaurant. The Breakfast was rich in content and was delicious. The Live singing in the evening was pleasant.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

188,We enjoyed stay n dinning n very good service,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
189,The hotel was super crowded and had blaring loud music playing through the day from 10-7 PM. These were mostly hindi songs so there was not much to relax and enjoy. The staff was not very friendly and there were certain instances that brought the level of experience down. The beach is a 200 m walk from the hotel and the breakfast is good.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Few negatives about the hotel : does not have slides and swings for small children (below 5), no bathtubs and no shacks on the beach just behind the hotel - one has to walk more half a mile to reach the shacks (difficult with children).

214,"I wanted to have a good vacation with least botherations this time. Although we had booked the hotel well in advance, I looked through the hotel reviews only a few days before our vacation. After reading the reviews, I had lot of apprehensions and worries regarding the quality of the stay in store for us. Very soon, I realised that I could keep away all my apprehensions away and enjoy my holiday. We were picked from the station very promptly and dropped at the hotel. The rooms as specified were ready for us. All inclusions as promised were met. Room service was excellent although a little expensive. Food was very good. Resort ambience and atmosphere was excellent. There is total privacy for each of the rooms (Deluxe rooms). The beach nearby (Candolim Beach) was not very good to have fun...except for some quiet moments if anyone wishes to have. Overall...the stay was excellent at Whispering Palms Beach Resort.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

217,"Goa is a wonderful place for a holiday and Whispering Palms provided us with a lovely experience of the Goan hospitality. The services of the hotel were very good as was the up-keep of the hotel. The buffet meals had a lot of variety. The evenings by the pool with the entertainment made the scene lively and enjoyable. Had there been some group activities organised for children, that would have been ideal. Overall a welcome break.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
218,"Most liked thing about hotel is ambiance, interiors and exteriors of hotel. Swimming pool is very good and pool side restaurant is very nice to enjoy.

Overall enjoyable and must visit place for sure.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
219,We stayed on 31st July to 3rd Aug stay in Whispering Palms. We promise when we are in Goa we would stay there. Staff is so cooperative and food quality excellent especially chicken. Swimming pool is okay. Very good location and taxi stand is near by gate. Night dj and music is also very good for dance with family. So just go and relax and enjoy in Whispering Palms.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
220,"Loved the ambiance, it was peaceful and clam, service was also really nice had so much fun.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
221,"Stayed with the family on vacation. The following are the positives. 1. The staff went out of their way to ensure (special mention for the front office manager Jesse) that the check-in issues were sorted in no time and made us feel valued. 2. The location is the best. One cannot get a better spot than this. 4-5 minutes walk ensures that you can go/come back as per convenience. This is especially helpful if you are with young ones and you would want to come back for various things (include untimely nature's calls they may have) 3. Food was good, breakfast spread was okay I keep traveling for work extensively and stay in mar pott's, Hilton's, and Hyatts. So my expectations are generally very high from any stay experience. The property is not very swanky compared to a 5-star resort. For example the lobby area, room finishing, etc, however, the room we were given was comfortable with an outside sitting area.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

226,"Breakfast buffet was good. But rooms require more cleanliness, AC unit was not working initially but maintenance person fixed it quickly. Balcony was not that useful. First floor rooms might be more good. The resort does not have any view but good for family or group stay.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
227,"For the price you pay per night it is not worth the return. Property is old and not upgraded. Approach to the rooms is very dingy and congested. Rooms very small and outdated. Wash room was smallest that I have seen. Mattress was over used and I could feel the pinch of spring in my back. Breakfast spread was limited and not at the standards of a 4 star. Good to book if price per night is ranged between 2.5k to 3k.

230,"The hotel welcomes you with a cheerful violin player. Your room might be located on the first floor without a lift, so keep that in mind if you have senior/disabled members in the group. The room was spacious. The biggest let down for us was the restaurant which did not seem like a 4 star at all. The pool was small and filled with a group of young men, so couples and people with children were not comfortable with using it. One big plus point is that the hotel is at a walking distance from Candolim Beach. Had informed in advance that we were visiting for our anniversary trip but no special preparations were provided. All this was in a lot of contrast against Taj Fort Aguada where we had our next day booking.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Kudos to the management, great job.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
237,"While it is a value for money Resort situated in close proximity to the Beach, it lacks the finesse of a true Resort.

238,"The hotel was located in a place that allowed access to shopping and also to the beach. Most of the staff was very accommodating with our requests. The rooms were cleaned daily. There was staff on hand throughout the day taking care of the grounds. The shuttle service to and from the hotel was wonderful. I do wish that the hotel was more helpful in accommodating visitors to touristÂ’s sites around the area. It was very difficult to get information from the hotel about how to get to the local temples, churches, and spice plantations. Taxi services were there, but we never knew who to trust. The food at the hotel was fabulous. Their breakfast was average, but the dinners had a great selection of foods for all individuals. Their ""jacuzzi"" was merely a kiddi pool next to the larger pool. It was not heated, nor did it have any type of bubbles or jets to move the water.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

I stayed with my family for 2 days and the experience was awesome. This is the 2nd time I am visiting. Food was good, can have more options for vegetarian customers .. The Chefs were really concerned as we did not eat a complete meal on a given day, they literally came and asked if anything can be made separately and prepared a separate dish for us to our liking.
The beach is close by - 5 mins walk from the resort. You can hear the waves in your room at night! What a lovely experience!

There were different entertainment every evening - one singer Kerry was too good. Not so good was the prawn balchao. WiFi was not useful at all, connectivity was poor. Beach access was not upto our mark - we expected a sea view but the facilities are bit away and there is small passage to ocean front.

350,It was overall a good experience. Room service is a bit slow but staff is quite courteous and food is amazing. Breakfast of this place is commendable. I was totally in love with the resorts environment. Even in the rains they maintained cleanliness. Room services are little slow but overall I loved the stay. Refreshing it was. Conveyance to airport and city can be arranged easily as a taxi service is stationed just outside the hotel. The pool area is clean but is closed after 7 pm.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
351,Worst experience they do not take any safety precautions,1,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
352,"They charge high for the quality they provide. Breakfast ok. Rooms not that posh. Only ups about it would be, its walkable distance from beach.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
353,"I was deeply saddened. With the quality of service I have received in the hotel. They say no outside alcohol is allowed in the hotel your room. This is pathetic rule. I am totally unhappy with the service. Desk people are unresponsive. No one picks up call easily. Ice bucket is charged. Room is so small. No view. Very dirty balcony. In short, a holiday spoiled. Location is very interior.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
354,The hotel was good. But the staff had no courtesy. We did not like the service quality. After reading the reviews I booked this hotel. Food was also not that good. Instead of all this we had great time here.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

356,"My wife and I spent 3 nights here. It was a most comfortable and pleasant stay. Despite the hotel being full, the housekeeping and room services were prompt and thoughtful. The food was good and plentiful. The chef even cooked a special fish curry to enjoy free of charge along with the regular dinner buffet. The nearby beach is relatively peaceful, while the 24 - 7 revelry at Calangute is a short drive away. We have no complaints, only praise for the hotel.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

A good clean resort, excellent service and house keeping, very diverse and excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner menu was served ... Kids enjoyed a lot. The swimming pool is clean.

They always serves same food like a hotel serves in Agra / Jaipur / Delhi... Means same idli, sambar, chicken etc.. Goa is known for it's seafood but Hotel doesn't care for it.. We come from Agra and we were not expecting always North Indian food in Goa.. We wanted something typical Goan Food but we were totally disappointed to see the repetitive Menu always.. Same Chicken / fish/ Mutton... Need to change...",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
373,"Overall, very good experience. The rooms on first floor were good and comfortable. However, the corridors were not so clean. Lot of housekeeping material was dumped. Upon request of two rooms together the Hotel team later gave two adjacent rooms. Food and service was excellent.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
374,"It was a different experience of staying in a nature surrounded, greenery resort and unlike staying in multi-storey boxy hotels. It will give you a feel like a proper resort. Quite spacious with all basic amenities, in just 2 mins walking distance from the Candolim beach. Loved their swimming pool too. Staff were also good and customer friendly. Only problem was with frequent power cuts, though they have generator back-ups and turn up time is hardly 30 -60 secs, it will keep you in dark for a moment.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Will definitely choose the same hotel for staying when I visit next to Goa. Worth every penny.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
378,In my 4 days visit I was there for one night. Place is quiet happening. Poolside area is good. Front desk staff was very helpful. Food is tasty and off course Mr Tom. The villain performer at entry is a gem person. Sharp memory guy who is very cheerful. Always greets everyone in his own musical style. Candolim Beach is just 5 mint walk or 1 minute scooty ride. I will visit there soon with my family.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
379,"I just came for a couple of days in off season and yet the hotel was maintained well. It has a nice swimming pool with a separate kids section but what I observed was that there were people assigned to handle ur infant while u can enjoy your swim, which shows their eagerness to help. The handing of the room was smooth and took just five minutes. Rooms were neat and clean. Food was also very good at their main restaurant breeze. The only thing I didn't like or you may say I was disappointed was they were still using old fashioned cylindrical locks instead of cards. Barring that everything about this hotel is good. Would definitely come here next time and recommend to others.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
380,"Very nice hotel, near to Candolim Beach (walking distance 5 minutes). Very helpful and cordial staffs who were fulfilling our every requirements. Highly recommended hotel. One can avail bus to go Calangute/Baga (10 minutes by bus) or can avail taxi/scooty available very near to hotel. Food varieties are good, special mention Chinese food but little improvement is required in North Indian food. Overall a top class experience.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
381,"The hotel is nothing what it looks like in the images. The rooms have damp bedsheets and the balcony has very bad maintenance. Rooms are very badly maintained. All the common areas are used by everyone and i don’t see the staff sanitizing the tables, chairs etc. I will never come again",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
382,"Good location just 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Nice staff, nice food, good ambiance. The staff co-operated but lacks in communication. Like there was a time during the day when water was not coming in the room so then they solved the problem but forgot to inform us. Another instance was we called for a cab to head back they did call for the cab but again forgot to inform us. Overall a good experience.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
383,Location was good and food was awesome.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
384,"Overall resort is very good, clean and nice property. 1. We visited during last week of Sep 08. 2. My expectation was to have a resort on beach, expecting beach to be well maintained as I have seen earlier in Sri Lanka and Mauritius. But you find limited such resorts in Goa and that too very costly, more that 4000 per day. 3. Whispering Palms Beach Resort was located very close to Condolim beach in comparison to other resorts. It was very near to Fort Aquada and Calangute, main places to visit. 4. It is not good for people who prefer to walk to places like Calangute main market. But market can be reached easily (just 5 km) if you hire local vehicles like bikes, Activa, rented cars. 4. Normal restaurants, general shops are very nearby. 5. Hotel staff was well in time for pick up and drop to airport and even for half day sightseeing tour as was in my package. 6. I would suggest hotel package should include Jacuzzi also. 7. We got resort at nominal price through MakeMyTrip and for us it was really value for money.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

387,Everything is nice in the hotel except for ac. It looked like the rooms as not properly sanitised. My son and husband became sick after sleeping in the room for 2 hrs in the room with ac. Other than that food was excellent. Room was also neat but needed more sanitisation during these pandemic times.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
388,Awesome experience of the Resort amenities and superb spell of monsoon in Goa added five stars to our vacation. Location of the Resort is good with easy access to the Beach as well as main Candolim Road. Ride on scooter in this awesome weather simply delightful.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
389,Not that great experience with hotel not at all value for money,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
390,"The hotel is good value for money. Fantastic food. The location is in the prime tourist area, which is most of the attractions. Beach is just 2 minutes it is not beachside property and no sea view. The staff are really good and friendly and attentive.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
391,"Good location, nice food and excellent service.
Exceptional customer satisfaction.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
392,"The location is good, very near to the beach, Has a very good swimming pool with dining by the pool and good food provided in buffet. I stayed in a studio suite room with family for 3 nights. The pictures flatter the room and is smaller than what it looks like in pictures. There were a few rooms which looked bigger but are not allocated (I am assuming here and could be wrong) to people booking via travel sites or may be just allowed to foreigners. Not enough explanation was provided regarding why bigger rooms with bigger balconies are not provided. Moreover, had a massive power cut due to failure in their internal transformers. Had loss of power for around 4 hours and staff had a ""your problem not our concern, problem will be fixed soon but cannot tell a specific time for fixing the problem"" attitude, first time I had encountered such a big power cut in any of the above average hotels in India. Would probably not stay there again.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

395,"It was my birthday and my friend told the staff for the same too, where we were advised that a complimentary cake would be provided which they never gave throughout the day and primarily toiletries and bathroom slippers are what you expect from a 4 star property. Yet we had to ask for it, where the staff room service took more than an hour for room service to respond. All i can suggest the staff is to be prompt.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
396,"It's a overall good hotel break fast is fantastic, service is good. There evening events are also good, food is excellent best part is very near to beach its only 150 meters to candolim beach. Its fantastic view from terrace.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
397,Very familiar feeling. I enjoyed my stay with good food and services. Beach access was not so far. Good and cream location to spend holiday with family. I will come back in next season.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
398,This hotel is not a 4 star hotel but MMT saying 4 star equal.,1,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
399,The hotel has some balcony rooms with not so great backyard view and we had to ask for change which we got next day. I am sure most people would ask for change for those rooms and the hotel should not keep those rooms for advance bookings. The rooms are standard 2-3 star kinda rooms which is pricey for the amount you pay. It's walking distance from beach which is really convenient. The hotel has a baby pool but a kids play area is missing. One awful thing was they don't have standard help like renting a bike or car but will divert you to nearby taxi stand and we could take get any to rent. This we found helpful in other good hotels in Goa always. The food was good and the room service too.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
400,"This is one of good place to go around with family in Goa, it is near to beach and other attractions Candolim beach is one of the best beach in Goa you have plenty of shacks near the resort and swimming pool looks clean and tidy and have continental breakfast.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
401,"Only good thing about this hotel is presence tom, he is very welcoming staff.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
402,"While we were there construction of new units was in progress. The area was not cordened off and one had to pass over rubble, open electric cables, loose tiles over the pathway. The way to the rooms was prone to accidents. Work was going on right through the day and night. It was difficult to sleep with the noise of stone / tile cutters and grinders. No helmets were provided to guests passing through the area under construction. We were asked to pay cash for some of the services or pay 5% extra towards credit card payment. There was hardly any Goan dish on the food menu. Quality of food was poor. Frankly, we were disappointed.",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
403,"Horrible room service, rooms are too small and smelly. Hated it. Had to ask for room cleaning thtice. Same is case with WiFi password, water bottles and toilet paper. Had asked twice for room freshner still did not get any. There activities about which no one mentioned it to us. Not at all value for money.",2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

406,"Location of the hotel is very near to candolim beach. Always prefer to have room facing pool, as pool is the most lively place of the hotel. Breakfast buffet was good. We had wholesome breakfast there. Staff members were very amiable. I felt the rooms need little improvement. We had Spa from the hotel, it was good and was at affordable price.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
407,My stay in Whispering Palms was pleasant. Service was very good. Room quality was good. Breakfast was good as usual. Lunch and dinner buffet quality was not worth the money. Wifi was not available though the website suggests it has. Airtel connection is very bad in that area. Big plus is location as it is just two mins from beach.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
408,The resort was very good and we enjoyed a lot. We have taken a Delux Room during Valentine's Day and the hotel has arranged a pool side party and that was too good. The beach is just 2 minutes walk and that not much crowded and that too only foreign people. Overall worth for money.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
409,Very good hotel. It is near to beach condolim. For buffet breakfast need more south Indian items. Swimming pool was good and clean. Panjim city is about ten kilometers. Main road is five hundred meters.,5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

411,"Resort is good in terms of location, facilities, cleanliness but the only problem is that in the resort 80% are foreigners only and indian people are too less and they are more concentrating on foreigner only and hospitality is more towards foreigners.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
412,"Even though the rooms were spacious, they were very basic and looked a bit worn out. Bathroom had a musty mothy smell that I disliked. Breakfast was limited. Location was the only plus. Staff was average, didn't know about local water sports and not very helpful. Not worth the money being spent honestly.

Staff very helpful. Doors of adjacent rooms too close to each other. Everytime the neighbouring door is used knocked, you think it's yours.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Plenty of food options around the place. Bigger rooms. Bad: Rooms at ground floor are very close to common area/pool, so little privacy, no air/breeze in the balcony. Very little lighting in the room and AC did not switch on every once we came back to room. Very slow housekeeping/room service. Food is quite expensive around.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

422,It is an average hotel to book.,3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

424,"It's a decent hotel (not a resort). Not much to really do at this property. It's just a pool surrounded by rooms. Breakfast was decent on the first day, better on the second. No complaints as such, but we were expecting much more from a Rs. 5000 a night property. Probably OK if you are paying 2500-3000/ night.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
425,My overall stay was good at this hotel. The goods are: - Beach side location - Activities (they organize) - Pool (The hotel is packed from the Foreigners in peak season) However there are lot of space for improvements and make it more better. - Taste of food - Empathy towards customer - Travel desk (Sight seeing guidance),4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

The hotel service doesn't deserve any star ratings. Number of better options also available at similar location.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

Buffet breakfast is great with loads of veg and non-veg spread plus continental spread is also great.

433,"In third day of my stay, the false ceiling in bathroom fell down on it's own. Thankfully my family was in room and not in Bath area hence we were saved from a big accident. The customer relations manager proposed giving a new room but we were terrified seeing the low quality of maintenance hence I booked a new hotel for third night and insisted on refund which thankfully the hotel manager complied to pretty quickly.

There is a library, which one of the managers brought me to, as it isn't that easy to find. There is a gym, but unfortunately, the equipment is very out of date and a bit risky health and safety wise.
Should mention that we met many guests who have been going back to Whispering Palms every year for many holidays, that says a lot about the hotel.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

467,"Great resort, very close to the beach and close to shops and restaurants 3 minutes walking distance to both. Room was to a high standard with a good size balcony overlooking the resorts gardens. Rooms cleaned daily, toiletries and tea or coffee facilities replenished daily. Friendly staff. The reason why this was not an excellent experience is purely down to the poor WiFi. We only did bed and breakfast but there is plenty of food or drink available directly at the resort if required at a reasonable price. Note that the hotel is an hours drive from the airport.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
468,"Excellent hotel with good food, room with all the amenities. Nice entertainment in the evening. Breakfast menu is too good with supportive staff all the time for everyone. Pool size is also nice & cool.",5,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
469,"The hotel was excellent in every department, be its food, services etc. I especially liked the performances by different artists, singers every night. Morning buffet was great. The only drawback I would say is a bit far from the main beach. Still would like to stay here if I go Goa again.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
470,"Whispering palms Beach Resort is very good hotel and all staff are also very nice They are very helpful. specially reception staff are excellent. We really enjoyed stopping at this hotel, The resort is situated in Candolim which is one of the best areas of Goa. The best part of this resort is the distance to the Candolim beach. You can get to the beach in just 5 minutes",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

473,Wouldn't mind recommending this resort to my friends. It was a wonderful stay. The hotel staffs were polite and helpful. The only issue was the buffet. I would prefer a better variety of non-veg food.,4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

477,"Goa... what a place.. we reached whispering palms after taking a cab from Mapusa and on first look the hotel seemed to be in between the average and the wow category. We gave our details and since we had early in the day (the checkin times are 1300) we had to wait for around an hour for a room to be alloted to us. (the hotel was sold out the previous days). As far the location is concerned the hotel is a three-four minutes walk from the beach. The hotel is well located between Fort Aguada and Calangute and is easily accessible to most parts of North goa and is about 13 km from Panaji. We had booked for the classic room, which is in the newer areas of the hotel. The classic rooms were clean and spacious. (I did have a chance to see the standard rooms, however they seemed a little cramped to me). None of the rooms from what I saw had a beach view, some of them have a view of the sea from a distance. The large rooms had all amenities including a garden facing balcony and a large couch in the room. The washroom was large and clean, the bath fittings needed a bit of plumbing. Would have liked to have hot water option available round the clock. We made good use of the pool and the Jacuzzi in the hotel. The hotel has a pool side restaurant and a bar and it is quite convenient to lounge around and relax. Wanting to try most of Goas cuisine we did not make full use of the resorts restaurants. The morning breakfasts were good and normal as far as breakfasts in hotel go. Live entertainment and buffet dinners is likeable for a day or so, however there is a lot more to explore in Goa than to hang out in the resort for your entire stay. The business end for visiting goa, the beach is walkable and quite convenient. The beach is the quiter one, where you can have a good time in the waters, the standards shacks and umbrellas around, though the huge washed out ship on the shore is an eyesore. Calangute is quite nearby for the water sports and other adventures. Overall the resort is a good VFM, convenient, has good standards and is doing great business mind you as it was packed for most of our stay.",4,Whispering Palms Beach Resort
478,"Overall a nice stay!

481,Its a average hotel property in Goa if you want to stay in an average property then only choose the hotel. The services and cleanliness is just according to a 02 star budget hotel. So plan accordingly before you plan to visit or stay in this hotel.,2,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

489,"On arrival at the hotel I was a little disappointed as the photos on the website really made the place look a lot nicer than it is in reality. Although in saying this, the place was still quite lovely, with all of the facilities advertised being available. It was quite close to the beach, a 2 minute walk away, but itÂ’s not really a great place for swimming - particularly for those who aren't strong swimmers and I was a little disappointed there were no beachfront cafes/restaurants to eat at. Staff at the hotel were very helpful and they upgraded our room for us when requested with little fuss. A very good place for families with young children. I don't really recommend the half day tour though as it was really hot on the bus (non-AC) and packed in, and the sites we were taken to seemed fairly random and others just plain odd! The food on offer in the p was acceptable, although the buffet style offerings may not be good for all. All in all though, it was quite a reasonable place to stay.",3,Whispering Palms Beach Resort

4226,Water heater was not working well,1,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4227,"Service: I would say service is poor. The security at the front was rude & irritated us even as v were checking in.
Rooms: What the resort people have done is they have beautified the exterior so that you shouldn't be bothered by the rooms. V got two rooms. In one room, can't get the key out of the door lock, in another you can't open the locked door itself. It caused lots of frustration. Imagine you return from party tired & ready to crash, but the door won't open. Half our time was spent doing that. Not what v want for the money v pay. They won't send anyone to help quickly also.
Location: perfect spot. A river or backwater runs along one side of the resort. But be warned, it stinks. Saw jelly fish there. Next, if you cross the main road, you reach the beach. So it's not a beach cottage as in. So no beach view from rooms.
Facilities: swimming pool, rain dance setup, play area, disco. Breakfast is very basic.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

No level of hygiene and staff also don’t answer much. The sheets were dirty and had stains in it",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4341,The staff was very friendly. The assistance provided by Mr.Chandra Pratap was wonderful and the food was very delicious. The rooms have some smell due to the walls absorbing moisture.

4343,"Stayed here for two days in November 18. Rooms looked good from the uploaded pick. At the venue, the surroundings were good and maintained. However the rooms were just the opposite. Our room smelled musty. Later after the window was put on, the smell went. The large window could not be locked, which was repaired later. Paint was flaking off. Bathroom attachments unclean, rusted, poorly maintained. Lighting and TV was fine fortunately. They gave complementary 2 bottles of mineral water everyday. Only good part was the breakfast which was superb and that it's a stones throw from the beach. On asking they said that they had recently taken over the hotel from a previous owner and were in the process of renovation. I guess they should renovate first and then let out rooms.
Poorly maintained, paint flaking off, overall musty smell of the room, window AC noisy, large window latch broken. Fixed later.",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4344,"Resort room and layout is pretty good. Beach is just a 2 min walk from resort. But hotel staff and their services are pathetic. We did not get any water bottles till 5 hours of check in. The worst part is that someone entered into our room in night time around 9. 00 pm when we went out for dinner. When I complained to hotel reception, he just kept quite and didn't even felt sorry about that. If you order some food there please expect a delay of 1 hour. But I must say food quality is good.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

4349,"Please be aware of The taxi union that is outside The resort's entrance. We faced a lot of issues with them and The reception never gives you information on The same. They caused a scene and were very rude. The Resort is situated walking distance from The Beach. We chose to stay at The place because it was suggested by The bridal entourage. The reception knowing that we had come for wedding didn't provide us with The itinerary that was supposed to be given to The wedding guests residing at The Resort. Reception is kinda sloppy in their service and needs to improve. Stay wise, room was spacious however small things like checking The telephone is working, proper, enough of curtains, false ceiling in The bathroom, coffee, tea sachets, etc need to be looked into. The a complimentary, free breakfast is a disappointment and can be improved. Overall this would be a blast resort place if I ever go back to South Goa.
Most important thing is to be aware of The taxi union outside The Resort. My mother and I faced a lot of issues with them. The reception never gave us information on The above. Also since we came for a wedding, The reception hadn't given us our it nary that was to be given for guests coming for The wedding. The breakfast provided was sad, expected better. Service was sloppy. The telephone had an issue. Also The curtains didn't close properly and were not fixed properly. The false ceiling on top of The shower was completely exposed.

Check in time was 12 pm and we reached there at around 01. 30 pm but still room was not ready. They gave one room which is full of bad smell, no towels, phone was not working, no water bottles, no tea maker kettle. After complaining about it they allotted different room but still all the problems were same. Hotel staff at reception was also rude and not polite at all. Even after requesting for water bottles for so many times, we did not get the water. We had to buy it from outside. By the time we actually checked in and settled, it was already 3. 30 pm. Lunch was also over by then. We actually wasted our personal time in all these things. All hotel staff was actually busy in impressing foreign tourist/guest.

Extremely poor house keeping. 6. Nobody at the pool side to serve beverages. 7. The staff seems very demotivated and highly unfriendly appears as if they are working against will. Pro: The one and only good thing about the hotel is it's proximity to the beach. Period. There are much better options close by. Please check them. I am really disappointed. The property is nice and management needs to improve to seek repeat customers.,2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

Main thing this is pure Veg Hotel .. And in Goa Veg doesn't find right.",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

I will rate it as 2. 5 out of 5,2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4459,"Hardly 200 meters from Candolim Beach, the Resort is located. It is a big property with facilities such as pool, rain dance (na during off season), karaoke nights and restaurant. Rooms are okay, we had a basic room, The AC is old window style and they start acting up late in night (non-stop beeping). Coffee maker provided as well. Food was tasty and it is a veg Resort.

Only one liter of water bottle for 24 hours. You can't have another water bottle as housekeeping never pick up any call. This was a very bad experience. Only good thing here is food. They had very good food. I would rate for food as 5 star. Hotel is now in very bad condition. It looks like falling building. They just want to earn revenue without maintenance. Any to should have been well maintained before arrival of guests. We were roaming at 12 pm for another room which also in a very bad condition.",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4461,The location of the hotel is good. Several shacks are present nearby and the beach is very close. But the service of the hotel staff is terrible.

I initially had apprehensions as it was known as a pure vegetarian resort but me and my family have liked the tasty food there. Gentle and polite staff at the restaurant, same is the case with facilities staff. I was attended on time in some of my concerns regarding the infra at the room. Only concern is about the age and look and feel of the resort, it needs an immediate face lift!",4,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4465,"This resort is located right next to Cavelossim beach, so you can go to chill at the beach any time during the day and come back.

4467,"Everything was excellent only the services need improvement. As a couple we enjoy a lot. This our first trip in Goa also 2nd trip on Byke Resort as we gone to Matheran also in same resort. Anyway the stall service near pool man is arrogant as he is not respecting the customer, for swim costume he cheat customers and also not hear anything for payment no ethics it must be outside from the resort as he is telling he has not any connection with resort payment. Hotel management should take action against them. Overall resort is Good I will visit again.

Food - It is a pure vegetarian place. The food taste was alright. The morning breakfast had a good spread. Rooms - The rooms need maintenance, lot of things were not working right. The facilities are pretty basic and hence did not find it value for money. Check-in process - Was extremely time consuming and the rooms were not ready. The allocated rooms did not have things in order, AC not working, geyser not working, towels missing, kettle missing, etc. Housekeeping - Pathetic service. The housekeeping department is understaffed and hence any request with them takes ages to get sorted out. Location - Awesome. This is the best part of the resort. Located right opposite the kovalam beach They just need tidy up a bit on the rooms and housekeeping part and they are good to go.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

The moment you enter, it had a smell as if the same has not been opened for many days and we were bitten by mosquitoes all night as one of the windows was not closing and had to summon the maintenance people to do the needful. Overall, the property needs a good renovation as all the hotels nearby are pretty good and well maintained.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

4479,"Room cleanliness not good. Shower was not in very working condition. Didn't get hot water for shower most of the time. Funny part - The pool-bar guy expects you to carry cash to the pool! He kept asking for cash payment and on lots of convincing, agreed to put the bill on the room number. Not advised to stay here unless you have your own vehicle to travel nearbuy. The Cabs in the hotel will put hole in your wallet unnecessarily. Minibar fridge was empty. Coffee pot had some residues inside, was unclean. NO LOCKER?
Advice to Hotel - You have a great hotel location, you can seriously improve on service to get more tourist to you.
IMPORTANT - Do not take the boating and Dolphin Safari with the guy in the hotel or on the Cavelossim beach. He will reduce rate a bit and will no service in return. We were given no proper food. In fact we were given some leftovers! The said unlimited beer was out of stock when we just had 2-3 beers per head. There is no spot for snorkelling, so no point listening the his snorkel ling blaber. A total thug! And he will ask for full payment before you sit in the boat, and then will never appear to take your complains.",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

The rooms initially shown were stinking, walls like there was a water leakage since 1990. Sometimes the refrigerator doesn't work, sometimes the TV is not in the room, and sometime the phoneline doesn't work - just simply because there is no wire in the backend (I stayed in 419, and had to use the phone of neighbouring room)

Every trip I made to the reception there was some one standing there shouting from Indians to Russians had complaints and were not satisfied with the room. It was sad to see the girl at the reception in tears as she couldn't handle the complaints, Even the pool was closed for a day without informing. The staff at the restaurant were non cooperative.

It was worse than some lodges that one may have seen. Throughout my stay, the TV's reception was extremely poor. When I complained the maintenance staff told me that it was bad for all the rooms in the resort and it cannot be rectified. He told me he was frank with me as I was a local guy and for the foreigners they usually don't tell the truth!This should only be booked if you get it for free and you don't have a family with you. The swimming pool was the worst that I have seen in terms of cleanliness. The reception was under staffed and I could find people arguing with them whenever I happen to be there. The breakfast had variety but few of the Indian food items were stale at best. Please avoid this one and book some other place. This resort is basically catering to foreign tourists who are looking for cheap accomodation for a significant longer period of stay. I will want to avoid this one at any cost.",2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

The location of hotel is excellent very close to Mobor Beach, you can also visit Colva and Varca beach 20 min drive distance (best beaches of Goa in terms of Cleanliness - White sands), property is also good, food is also tasty, But one major issue of this hotel is there services you need to tell them 10 times for any room service (AC was not working, Tv was not working, ). They have 2 restaurants but when you will sit there for dining you will have to tell them many time to bring water, to take order, we have waited for an hour just to give order and after giving order they took another 30 min to bring food. Staff are not trained for proper services. Even Buffet service was not proper. There is NO option for food nearby for Vegetarian people.

4723,"When I first got the hotel booked through MakeMyTrip I wasn't really sure of how good or bad the accommodation would be. I just read a few reviews about the resort and got it booked as the deal I was getting at that point of time was pretty reasonable and pocket friendly and the pictures of the resort were quite attractive. Frankly speaking I didn't really trust the pictures and the review until I actually reached the location as the amount I had paid to book the stay was much less as compared to the prices per night charged for other 4 or 5 star properties. I take pleasure in reviewing the property. It is value for money and even more. The lush green property spread in acres of land with the view of riverside lawn and the cavelossim beach just 200 meter away ensures you a really enthrilling stay at the peaceful and calm holiday at posh location of south Goa. The ambience of the rooms was good, rooms are pretty clean and decent. Nice sofa cum bed and a small table to enjoy your chilled beer at the room. A small bedroom fridge to chill your stuff. Decent space and furniture. As for food I give a 5 on 5 rating more so because we are vegetarian and it's the only vegetarian restaurant serving the entire Goa. Except for the south indian preparations we liked every cuisine served. The deals are a must try specially the dal tadka. All in all I give it a 4 out of 5 rating.

In fact the tea kettle had fungus on it !! Cups were having stain marks. Quilt were having blood stains .. Walls were not painted and looked like the walls of govt quarters of 1980’s. I have posted photos of the rooms. To conclude this is not a 3 star hotel as shown on travel websites .. It’s definitely not worth the money.

4766,"Location of Hotel and Rooms are good. Poor services of billing section. Poor Wi-Fi Connectivity. Strongest routers should be installed. Housekeeping and room service departments are also not efficient. Dirty bed linen. Whatever facilities are read online are not actually provided. Transportation from the Hotel to the Airport is Rs 500 costlier than the normal taxi charges. Very poor connectivity from the city. Except Taxi nothing is available. Cab rental stations not present. The best thing is that A very neat and clean Sea beach is at the walking distance from the Hotel. The garden of the Hotel is nicely maintained. But the cleanliness of the rooms are not maintained by not changing the bed linen every day. Many times dirty towels and bed sheets are provided in the rooms. Room tea coffee is provided for a single person in double occupancy rooms. Except a few staff members rest are careless. Best services and most careful people, we came across are Mr Shambhu of restaurant and Mr Yogi of IT department. The person sitting at the billing section needs to learn manner, ""How to hand over the paper to a customer. "" He never puts paper into an envelope before handing over. He is not willing to give the final check out details to the customers. Most of the staff members are not habitual of obeying the instructions. The ladies sitting at the reception make joke of the customers.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

4774,"I stayed in 'The Byke Old Anchor' from 22 Oct to 24 Oct 16. As this was my 2nd visit to Goa, rather than touring around the place, this time I preferred to a relaxing family holiday at a single location of South Goa. Beachfront hotels of southern part of Goa are known for their lonely relaxing holiday charm away from noisy crowded places of North Goa, but the 'The Byke Old Anchor' sets the bar high with a competitive price and their very friendly service. The beachfront location of the resort puts guests just steps away from lovely CAVELOSSIM BEACH over the main road on front the side and lovely boat riding on SAL RIVER on the rear side. Though the location is quite far from Airport, but if you prefer not to indulge in busy sightseeing of North Goa, you donâ€™t even need to leave the comforts of the hotel and seaside fun/happenings of Cavelossim Beach. You will be within walking distance to Carmona Market which is full of local dining mostly frequented by foreigners, specially Russians. The hotel offered us everything guests want for a romantic getaway or fun family vacation. Cottage type rooms that we were offered were neat &clean, spacious and equipped with all amenities which were promised at the time of booking. The air conditioner was working properly. Lights, fitting & fixtures inside the room were in very good condition. Found reception staff and other support staff very friendly. The cleaning staff on their part did fairly good job on daily basis. The resort has a very strict security arrangement in place and in one particular incident when my 4 yr old kid gone missing for a while, the whole hotel staff were there with me in search of my kid. The hotel offers complimentary Buffet Breakfast which is really HUGE with variety of continental and local food including variety of hot/cold beverages. The only thing I didn't like is their claim of free WiFi service - no matter how much you try, it just doesn't work there. Overall, I have a lovely memory of family stay there. Would love to visit back again..",5,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4775,"We stayed for 2 nights at the resort, booked 4 deluxe rooms for 8 people, the resort is very beautiful with beach and river nearby. The food served here was pure veg but, very tasty and flavorful, the only problem was, there were some stray dogs roaming around and one dog tried to attack one of my relatives and bite his hand due to which we had to go to south Goa hospital for his treatment and injections. We complained about the stray dogs but they were still roaming around in the resort till we checked out.",5,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

The service was really good and the restaurant staff was friendly. They serve very tasty vegetarian dishes and mouth watering breakfast. A perfect resort for a family stay. Cavelossim is a beautiful and clean beach which is just about 200-250 mtrs from the resort. The only suggestion I have is they can have a better information desk explaining tourists about nice places to roam around at Cavelossim, maybe a tourist map. One can easily catch a public transport bus from Margao to reach Cavelossim and vice versa.",5,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4779,Very spacious hotel. Location of the hotel is very good. Opposite beach and clean water. I found this beach is the cleanest of all. Hotel amenities are good.

We stayed for 1 day and checked out immediately the next day.,2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

The tap water was turned off by the hotel. The set top box was not working.

It looks as if the owners decided to give it one uniform coat of paint and decided it was good enough. Our room had an olden feel to it. Only one tiny geyser for 4 rooms which means basically no hot water. Breakfast was decent. There's a rain dance area which wasn't functional. The pool looked good, we did not use it.

Only plus point this hotel 100% veg hotel and foods is good. But last is not list house keeping staff poor.,2,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4800,Hotel is purely in remote area. For food you have to depend only on hotel as there is no near by restaurant available. If you are a non vegetarian then you have to try your luck. For travel and taxi hiring you have to depend on hotel backed travel agency called Chaye Wala. He charges are monopoly. If you are hiring outside taxi his team will put full effort not to allow there. So you need to come by walk up to certain distance to avoid fighting.,4,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa

4812,"Location of hotel and rooms is good just across the cavelossim beach. Poor service of reception and billing section they took about 35-40 min to check in that too at the dead of the night (2 am) God knows how they handle their guests during peak season. Receptionist took half an hour just to find rooms even when they have a computerised system for it, even after that they gave 2 rooms to us far apart. Wi-Fi is just for the heck of it. Very poor Wi-Fi connectivity and slow Wi-Fi, most of the time Wi-Fi was out of service. Housekeeping and room service is poor, if you order coffee or even water bottles they will take half an hour to bring it. They won't refill water and coffee supplies until you asked them and chase them, I stayed there for 5 days and only once or twice I got it by themselves otherwise I have to chase them for every thing. Their was some electrical problem with the room even after chasing them for 2 days to rectify it they couldn't. The electricity trips automatically and then you have to find switches to put on the lights and AC again. One night its happened 4-5 times, I requested them to change my room but even after that they didn't change or rectify the electrical problem. Facilities mentioned online are not actually provided. The swimming pool timing is from 8am to 7pm only, which I believe should be extended till 10pm. The worst part about the pool is they security guard in charge will start chasing from 6 pm onwards to get out of the swimming pool. Bed sheets was not changed every day. Used towels and bed sheets were given in the room. The Room service gave us Used refilled water bottles and when we took up this matter to reception they were like nothing happened. They were completely unapologetic about this. The ladies at the reception are very ill mannered and Rude, they should learn manners and how to treat their guests. Most of the guests in Byke are Russians nationals and the hotel staff does'nt seems to be interested in serving Indian guests. The buffet breakfast is not up to the mark. Not many choices for breakfast items, most of the items were bland in taste no salt or sugar in them. Sandwiches where like they were made from an old bread, hard and fragile bread. The property is well spread good big rooms nice and clean walk ways, well maintained garden, close to beach and next to Sal/Backwater River A good resort but with bad services and ill mannered staff.",3,The Byke Old Anchor Beach Resort & Spa
4813,"Before you choose, make sure you love vegetarian food and you can live without non veg. I booked this hotel for New Year eve. Ambiance, activities was good, the main problem was they charged me for 3K for mandatory dinner. Since I'm addicted to non veg, it was a big disaster for me especially in New Year eve. There is no wifi connectivity in rooms, but if you want you can surf in pool or reception. Wifi is damn slow, might be due to hotel is crowded. Rooms are neat and clean, the location is not that good, it's far away from heart of Goa. There is one beach in front of the hotel, but it's not that good as Baga (mainly for fishing).

The room service was poor and so was the reception. Also the rooms are very distant from the reception, so you have to walk a far way.

Mr. Mahendar was in touch with me for 2 days regarding the complaint made and no response after that. No solution provided yet.

Due to the flood conditions we reached Goa by train that also after 48 hrs after so much hectic journey. I have informed the hotel also by calling many times that I will be reaching next day due to flood and delay of the train, on phone call they told me that no problem you can come any time as I have paid the full amount. But when I reached Goa and called regarding my room booking the manager told me that my room booking is cancelled as there was no show of the guest. he told me to call MMT to rebook the room. MMT co-operated me fully but when i told the customer care about the trouble which I faced form the journey she requested the hotel manager to cooperate with the guest.

4948,My booking was deluxe room with breakfast and dinner but no buffet available for dinner or lunch. Only TDH menus available those are fixed. At a time of taking lunch. Staff wouldn't provide awareness and you feel I took lunch without pay but at a time of booking will pay heavy amount for this criteria.

5000,We stayed at this hotel in August. It was monsoons in Goa so we got the hotel at cheaper rate as compared to the rates during the season. It was 2 night stay. We had to checkout at 12:30 p.m. Since we had the baby it took as 15 more minutes to come out from the room as I had to feed her. At 12:20 am we informed at the reception to make the checkout bill but when we came to pay the bill we saw that they added extra more money in the bill and said that we are late in checking out. We had long argument with them. They were simply not cordial while talking with us and were literally yelling. Also we ordered a breakfast from them and we received half breakfast. We ordered omelette that they sent without toast. Later when we complained they sent burned toast after 20 minutes and later to cover up they said that we will make a fresh one for you for free. Who eats breakfast in short breaks. I hope this is their understanding for breakfast. Overall a poor stay.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5001,I will rate this hotel as a very poor category. Not at all value for money paid. Staff behavior poor. Food quality was poor. Got flies in food. Power cut after every 10 mins which kept resuming in every 10 seconds. And sometimes it took half an hour to resume power. Very disturbing stay. Not at all recommended.,1,Silver Sands Serenity

Overall a very good stay.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5005,The staff is rude to its customers. Rooms are good and well maintained.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5006,We stayed for almost a week. The most amazing part is that you don't have to take any vehicle on rent to visit Candolim Beach. You'll find ample number of cafe and lounge with live music which makes the place more happening. Hotel staff is way too supportive. Quickest service and cleanest pool. Highly recommended!,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5007,All things are good . The hotel was very good. The swimming pool is awsum. The food is awsume . The location is near by the beach. I will try to come again in this hotel. Money useful. I like this hotel very much. I am very surprised about this hotel,5,Silver Sands Serenity

Overall it's a very excellent stay.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5185,"We stayed for five days. The swimming pool was non functional and nothing was mentioned about it either. They gave us a secondary option.

To our surprise he had placed us next to the noisiest family where kids and parents screamed and shouted all evening! Their favorite seemed to be, 'who could slam the door loudest for 2 hrs straight'! Food was terrible. We got ill shortly after consuming it! Room was dirty as well! The only good thing I can say about the hotel is that the staff for the most part are courteous and helpful, except the guy who checked us in!

Couldn't see there swimming pool on 5th floor as it was closed for maintenance, but the owner has another property ""Hideway"" behind serenity and we were allowed to use that. Overall, it's a good place to stay and with the proximity to all the happening places in Goa. Only remark is they can add a bit variety to their breakfast menu as well the in-house cafe (Jose) menu and a bit of other activities like pool table, TT etc, however that is secondary.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

The hotel promised that the room is available and when we reached the hotel at 6 am they said that the room that we booked was unavailable and we had to wait till 12 pm to get the room and the only option was to upgrade the room to delux by paying extra. After which we asked about late checkout and they said to check-in the morning. As per their instruction, we checked in the morning asking them that we would be checking out late and asked the cost. We wanted to negotiate the cost and was informed to contact the manager who was coming the next morning. We contacted the manager the next morning and the manager all of a sudden said that the room is unavailable and we will have to check out by 11 am. when we informed that we have been asking the same from the time of checkout. He asked us to pay extra 6 hours. This was very disappointing and upsetting. We were asked to check out if we didn't pay extra. When we asked if we could move to superior room again. They said non of them were available and said we had to pay the money to continue in the delux room. After sometime when we again went to talk to them, they agreed to give superior room (which was unavailable initially). The way they make the money at this hotel is very disappointing. Wish they could be a little more courteous and understanding. Wish this hotel could be customer friendly. If you plan to stay here, please make sure you book for the correct days as they will charge you like crazy for extension.",1,Silver Sands Serenity

5327,"Hotel was good. Nice spacious rooms with amenities. Buffet breakfast was decent but could have improved on variety and taste. Nice place to stay for people inclined to stay at North Goa.
The hotel was pretty good except for the noise pollution that was being created by a plastic curtain which was placed all around the hotel probably to refrain the water to get in the balconies and rooms. Buffet Breakfast was decent but would have been better if more variety would have been provided. Apart from that a clean hotel at a very good location for people stating in North Goa.

5348,"I traveled with my wife and two kids. Booked a junior suite for 2 nights, room was really good and size of the room is also big. Best part is the infinity pool on the roof top, kids also enjoyed a lot. It is in center of Candolim, so shopping, restaurant etc everything is easily accessible. Breakfast was also good, made Jain food on our request. Management allowed an extended 2 hours checkout also as I was staying with 2 kids and got late for breakfast. Overall experience at hotel was pretty good.",5,Silver Sands Serenity

5351,"Overall experience was average. I feel room price was too high according to their facilities. Owner and staff is too rude to their customers. Book this hotel only if you don't care about respect. Owner will rudely show you the rules of hotel and will say, you are blind, you are not able to see the rules of my hotel. Best part is location of the hotel.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5352,It's amazing and near to the beach.,5,Silver Sands Serenity

5354,Location wise its good very near to candolim beach. You can walk to beach. Room is clean bathroom is also clean and spacious but the water from shower area spread to outer bathroom due to not proper seal of glass slider. Basin tap is also broken. Management should look after this.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5355,"Did not like it. Reception team, room cleaning all are below average. Over strict on water pool with an intention to make money by selling costume. I think the entire customer facing team badly needs a training on better hospitality.",1,Silver Sands Serenity
5356,It’s a very nice place to spend some quality time with your loved ones. It’s located in the centre of the city.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5357,"Good location, Good area but they lack the wow factor. They can add things which attract people. They have nice rooms nice space which they need to utilise as usp but they don't. No good Breakfast, very less options. Good rooftop swimming pool but not hygiene at all. Most importantly they have everything except hygiene and maintenance.
One more point I would like to suggest them, they should maintain dresscode for their staff.",3,Silver Sands Serenity

When we complaint about this many times and when we were complaining about this the general manager of the hotel reply us back with a statement that it seems like we have cum for complaint not for the vacation and this is india mein power supply ka problm hota hai. They don't cum back with the solution no reply, no candles in the room, we need to keep up calling they will never cum back to us. Disappointing service.

5424,"I think there were mites in bed. My wife and I were bitten at multiple locations. Though I couldn't find any ant or mosquito inside the bedding. I complained about it at the reception, the guy was totally unresponsive. Either he knew about the problem or he didn't care.",2,Silver Sands Serenity

5428,"I suggest to everyone go for this hotel. Because all thing is excellent like bed, bath tub, TV, breakfast view, swimming pool etc. But price is little bit expensive in off season so work on it.
There is nothing to dislike. Everything I like it in the room. All is good.",5,Silver Sands Serenity

5432,"Nice hotel, very close to Candolim beach and near by shopping area. Newtons is just 5mins walk away. Location is great, right on the main road candolim - calangunte. Its got a roof top pool with a bar counter which is wonderful and one of a kind in that location.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5433,It was my 18 months daughters first trip to Goa and staying in silver sand serenity was just a best decision.,5,Silver Sands Serenity

Had to suffice with bread butter and fruits. I complained about the taste of breakfast still next day same thing
Milk was more of water and breads were very dry
Unable to eat breakfast",2,Silver Sands Serenity
5436,"Beautiful rooftop swimming pool and hotel is located in market area and at walk-able distance from Candolim beach.
Watching sunset from the rooftop swimming pool is so relaxing.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5437,Services were poor. AC was spreading water and they weren't even consulting about customers satisfaction. I am feeling not to use MMT if they provide hotels like this.,1,Silver Sands Serenity
5438,"Charged extra for a kid, which was not told before booking.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5439,"Excellent location, walkable from candolim beach. It's a new property so everything feels and looks nice. The rooms look exactly what is shown in the pictures. Totally worth it. We were pleasantly surprised with it. We did not opt for breakfast so cannot comment on that. Cons/area of improvement- The shower door is not leak proof so the entire bathroom floor gets wet after taking a shower which is a little inconvenient as Goa is a beach destination and showers are used very often and the internet connection is hopeless.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5440,"otel basicallyRajat Bhatnagar .  . Aug 14, 2018When a hotel is a 4 star, with an asking price of greater for per night, one expects some different level of interaction with the staff. I got pissed off at 2 things, swimming costume could not be waived off on sincere request. What I had was not up to their norms and fortunately they had in house availability of that item at a price. So it looks a tactic to shell out money from customers. Cold response from bell boy or reception guy, no, nothing can be done is the attitude of staff there. They did not keep my bag after check-out for 2 hours as I had a valuable item in it called laptop. Surely, that bell boy must have agreed if I would have begged him to keep it or offered some money maybe. I think after paying that per day tariff I should not be asked to beg. Overall 3 star hotel.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5441,"Room was neat and clean, staff, location and breakfast was good but need to improve in dealing with tourist specially the behaviour of front desk was not acceptable. They denied for room booking from Make my trip. In spite of showing msg and email of booking confirmation ID no and voucher that was sent by MMT they were not ready to accept my booking in hotel. After 1 hour they allowed check in by asking you have to pay if they don't receive confirmation voucher from MMT. It was issue between MMT and hotel but Front desk staff spoiled my tour. I got disturbed and worried about double payment. Eventually I will say due to their mismanagement or greed or whatever matter my stay was not comfortable and their behaviour spoiled my visit.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5442,"Room was good even the services was nice, location perfect we thoroughly enjoyed the stay, swimming pool at the terrace whole Goa was visible lots of coconut tree, we had total fun. Nice and memorable stay",4,Silver Sands Serenity

5447,Good property with mindless management staff. They take customers as granted.,1,Silver Sands Serenity
5448,Hotel interior and rooms are good but parking is not properly. Pool location and top view are awesome. Overall a perfect stay for a couple.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5449,"This hotel is pathetic and staff was very rude, specially front desk and resturant staff. Being a hotelier They don't know how to speak with guest. The check in time is 2pm and we reached an hour prior to check time around 1pm I asked for early check in and I can see lot many check out was done but reception guy told me that hotel is sold out and we don't have room now but if you want you need to pay INR 4000 FOR early check in. just for one hour early check they asked 4000 rupees. Then there was no dental kit in the room and when I asked for that the reception guy told me that it is chargeable and will cost you 150 rupees.
No social distance no mask no temperature check. the staff grooming was also pathetic.
please please please don't book this hotel. I. this price you will get good 4star hotel like Radisson and golden tulip and all. don't book this hotel.
the location was OK but food and service was overpriced and bad quality.",1,Silver Sands Serenity
5450,Hotel was great with great rooms and best part was jacuzzi in bathrooms. But MMT service was poor and unacceptable.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5451,It's rated as a four star property but I don't think it's worth the price.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5452,Nice for stay at candolim. Specially love for pool.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5453,Hotel staff was rude in their behaviour and also dint help us when asked for taxi to bus stop. Not Worth the money at all expected a very good quality looking at the star but definitely not recommending this to my family or friends again.,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5454,Good hotel but service is ok. Staff is ok,3,Silver Sands Serenity

5458,"It was a pleasant stay in SSS. Hotel is near to the beach and that was the best part. The staff were very co-operative and the hotel was spotless. It was also near to Baga beach and anjuna beach. The bazaar was another attraction. We loved the breakfast too. Overall, it was a great experience",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5459,"It was a good stay at a good location, food we did not try.
An upgrade was provided by the Hotel.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

5463,We opted for breakfast for two days. Taste of different items can be improved. Got same desert items both the days.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5464,I have been to this hotel regularly with family and my alone trip as well. Never got chance to complain for this hotel. Staff is good and restaurant as well food ordered in the room as well is excellent. Highlight of this place is swimming pool where you can view football match as there is ground opposite to hotel. Only issue I See if parking if there are more guest as sometimes you need to Park the vehicle in basement. Apart from this all good and food rates also quiet reasonable.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5465,It was superb location and good hotel. Good experience and good staff. Service and also good timing price wise excellent hotels I check online but I am not sure that time but when I stay it's better than what I thought.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5466,"Very bad, breakfast service, all so not good.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5467,"Room was clean and awesome, breakfast was average, hotel staff is average, housekeeping was wonderful. Location is just adjacent to the various good restaurants and walking from candolim beach. You may not find a better deal in this location with such a nice property.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5468,It's a good property. With a good location. And infinity pool is best,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5469,Rooms are good but premises are very untidy. Staff is insufficient and somewhat arrogant. Surely not recommended.,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5470,Stay was good as the hotel is located at prime place.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5471,"Hotel is very good, but service is not good. Near to beach connected to 4 beach &Ford. 15 km from Panjim, 5 km from Baga beach, near to condolium beach",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5472,It had an amazing view from the pool area the rooms are nice but when it gets to maintaining those areas and providing service to the guests that's where this place disappoints they desperately need a better staff if they want any more business,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5473,"The staff was polite, breakfast was amazing, lots of variety, rooms, and washrooms were clean and the best part was the infinity pool with an amazing view.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5474,Location is good. The ambiance is good. Food quality needs to be improved and the behavior of staff. Good variety. Awesome place to stay.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5475,"Must say that the hotel is good and in an excellent location. The front desk staff was very helpful and courteous which goes a long way in ensuring repeat customers. Same goes for the room service and other support staff. This hotel has a swimming pool on fifth floor which gives it a lovely ambience and my kid loved the pool. Only issue which I felt was selective responsiveness of the staff in hotel cafeteria and Swimming pool which was more biased and quick when it came to someone with fairer skin tone. No fault of hotel management as maybe one or two guy are still not over the fact that we were once ruled by people with white skin. However, since a substantial guest would be from a country with brown skin, maybe the staff can be guided to be unbiased and equally courteous by hotel management. Overall, minus small issues as highlighted above, I would still like to stay again in this hotel.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

-Toothpaste and shaving kit was not provided
- Bottle water supplied was inadequate for two person.
-service can be further improved.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5483,"The most terrible stay in Goa. Booked 2 Junior Suits for family. The rooms have very strong foul smell, you feel like staying near garbage area. The staff are so ignorant, slow and insensitive that you after few interactions would just hope to complete your stay and move on.",1,Silver Sands Serenity

5493,We had to change our room three times as the air conditioning wasn't working fine. We asked for the dental kit but nobody informed us that I would be chargeable and they just added the price to the bill even for the bucket of ice. We have stayed in number of hotels but they always inform about the things they charge for.,3,Silver Sands Serenity

5498,Resort has no solar system and you have to waste water for 10 mins to get heat. Also water leakage in washrooms. Swimming pool timings are 9am to 6pm which we usually go out these duration which is not right.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5499,"3Prajwal Singh Thakur .  . Dec 08, 2018First I would like to start with the pros - location walk-able distance to candolim beach. Candolim is very good when compared to calungute and baga beaches and location wise as well. You find good food spots like fisherman's cove and good punjabi restaurants. Very good massage spots like Acasia and Aline's. Okay then. That's the only positives I could actually think of. Roof top swimming pool amazing concept and view from the terrace of the hotel. Now we come to cons - service for any hotel, service plays a crucial role in hospitality business. This hotel lacks it to the core. First the room service they don't turn up when you ask them to clean the room. We stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days. They were proactive only once in cleaning the room, when we called for the room cleaning, we had to wait for few minutes. The room service people were arrogant as well. They don't seem to think of ways to keep the room clean. When you visit Goa, getting dirt on your feet is a norm and they provide you only one door mat. Could have given 2 or 3. Breakfast same repetitive stuff from the hotel. Only one staff displayed great ownership and the rest were just dumb heads, when you ask them they say they will do it but nope. It's disgusting from the staff. I repeat only one staff member was good. The rooms don't resemble to what's shown in the pictures. I booked a junior suite room and to our surprise it was on the second floor. Usually good rooms are on the top floor, this was something that we didn't expect. Basic amenities like paste and brushes were missing and yeah bottled water supply. Only 2 bottles 500 ml will be provided for a day. Good hotels don't do that. Well that's it from my end. I don't ever want to come back to this hotel. Will choose something else. Thanks.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5500,It was awesome and superb stay with a politeness staff towards talking and also everything was overall good over here,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5501,"This was the first time I chose this hotel and found it beyond expectations, the staff is very friendly and warm and the food is excellent ambience ten on ten and fantastic experience, the room service is very fast Thank you",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5502,Value for money deal. Centrally located.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5503,"Good staff and food, near candolim beach and at good location",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5504,"The best part about the hotel is it is centrally located. Hire a conveyance, walk to Candolim, Street walking is safe nearby. However hotel is not so well maintained. Rooms are not as big as they are shown in pics. If you are going to look for calm surroundings and serenity - this is not for you.",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5505,"Food was good, staff was professional at times a little arrogant, room tariff for three nights was too high or possibly the junior suite room was not provided. Not recommended for stay. I stay 10-12 nights per month on similar or better hotels, hence have enough experience.
Writing table with chair was not provided. View from room was poor, it was on back side. Water bottles of were provided for 2 persons.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

Total waste of money. Don't prefer this hotel.",1,Silver Sands Serenity
5509,All staff member are bad and hotel is not provide good service. They did not mention how to use swimming pool and what needed things to use it.,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5510,"Rooms are good and clean. We did not use much of their service so no comment on the service. This hotel is on the main road and easy to get taxi or bus services. Candolim beach is walkable distance from hotel and Calangut beach also near. Room service items are bit expensive, but we can get food from outside hotels as there are many available just outside hotel. Though the room has a balcony, we could not sit there since some maintenance work is going on and sides are covered with sheet. AC is little noisy in the room.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5511,"ropertyRajkumar . Family Traveller . Feb 02, 2018Pool is ultra short and food is pathetic. You can't even eat. Very few option for breakfast. Small hotel just 1 are 2 star property.

Location wise is good. 10 mins walk to candolim beach.",3,Silver Sands Serenity

5519,Excellent place to stay. Staff very co operative. Food is good. Would prefer staying there again in my next visit. Overall fabulous.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5520,It seems to be old property but maintained property. Everything was ok at the property but the staff (particularly bell boy and manager) behaved totally non-cooperative. They were always found smile less. The manager was not ready to accommodate even the smallest request. We were 2 families and booked 2 rooms for 3 nights. We requested them to provide nearby rooms but the manager seems to be in no mood to even listen to the request and no one else is authorized to listen to the request.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5521,It is easily one of the best places to stay at while in Goa. Worth the 4 star.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5522,Stayed here for 2 nights. Spent 1 day in pool. Everything else about this place is average.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5523,"Nice experience, expecting lighting in night at rooftop swimming area, service was good.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5524,Just okay stay.,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5525,"I think the hotel is getting enough bookings because of the location and the management doesn't need or bother about their guests at all. At the check-in, we were given 2x rooms on the ground floor when asked for higher floor, the front desk promised for next day. We understand busy period owing to Independence day holiday and settled. Next morning, until 2 pm is still checking for availability and told us, it will take another 2 hours to offer us another rooms but on the 1st floor. What progress, from ground to 1st floor but even for that you need to wait for 2 hours. Despite of repetitive requests made, with no further expectations, we rested our case. And carried on with our next 3 nights stay only to realize that the corridor of the 1st floor was stinking. Not joking but this was the case. One of the rooms allotted to us had drainage issue and again after several phone calls the maintenance team only showed up 6 hours later to resolve but with no much progress. I can simply go. They really don't need guests and don't understand or value the word called as hospitality. Thank you Silver Sands Candolim, will never ever book with you again. Staff is good for nothing.
Rooms in the ground floor were super noisy and the room view and balcony was facing the back side of the hotel building with nothing great to see. Pathetic part was, the corridor was stinking badly as one of the rooms drainage was leaking with smell.",2,Silver Sands Serenity
5526,"Beautiful infinity pool.
Well maintained hotel and friendly staff.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5527,Our stay in silver sand serenity was a nice and relaxing experience. The only thing that could have been better is their check in time and their hospitality and curtecy during guest waiting for room allocation. Rest things are great.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5528,It's about 500 m from the Candolim Beach. There are many nice restaurants close to the hotel where you can eat lunch or dinner. The stay at the hotel was comfortable. Breakfast was decent. The hotel is clean. The only thing that I thought was an issue was the swimming pool water which was burning eyes and nose. Not sure if it was too much chlorine. Overall stay was good and I would recommend the place to others.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5529,Excellent view of arabian Sea from roof top pool.,4,Silver Sands Serenity
5530,"It's located very well, near the Candolim Beach approx 10 mins walking distance. It's right on the main road, near multiple bars and restaurants which have an attractive ambiance along with choice of food options, and a super market. Amenities are standard and good recommendation for families. Most rooms have a balcony. The Suresh is helpful and responsive. I do recommend this hotel if you wish to stay in North Goa.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

5539,"Overall stay was OK.
Nothing as such",3,Silver Sands Serenity
5540,"The standards of a 4 star hotels were met. Timings stated by them for various services were actuals. They have additional services like discount in their ""Bazar"" restaurant, free coupon for their Candolim beach shack which was nice. However they need to extend their pool timing.",5,Silver Sands Serenity

And value for money .. Breakfast spread could have been better and well managed .. A little extension in time should be given specially on weekends .. Over all a good and calm stay with great location.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5543,We booked 2 different rooms. Size of the room was good and washroom was clean too. But they could not provide us with a smoking room. We were asked to smoke on the ground floor which was not at all convenient. The WiFi was off and the staff was not at all bothered to help us out after number of complains. Staff at the pool was very rude. Overall the stay experience was average and not that great.,3,Silver Sands Serenity

5547,"Hotel stay was completely awesome, cleanliness hygiene totally perfect, need a lot of improvement in food taste the taste is not at all good and also rates are very high however we think if the food is good people won't mind in paying extra but they should improve the taste definitely. Lifts are not working properly need a proper maintenance.",4,Silver Sands Serenity
5548,"Most pathetic experience till now, poor service, suffocating room and smelly balcony with beautiful view of garbage all around. No one from the management bothered to atleast come once and check the room despite complaining. Checked out from this hotel just hours after checking in. Also the property no way deserves to be a 4 star in any sense. A big NO and will never recommend this hotel to anyone, Goa has much more beautiful resorts at a much cheaper price. Thumbs Down to this property.",1,Silver Sands Serenity
5549,The hotel staffs were quite rude & do not regret for their mistakes. They even did not bother if room service was not given by staffs. During breakfast hours we keep calling and they drop the receiver so it wont disturb them. We have never seen such bad experience and behavior. We demanded room service as per criteria of hotel but they denied giving it in the morning saying - if you want anything go to reataurant. We got stuck in a beach party and called them so many times as we need ticket prints for the next morning flight. They simply dint pick most of the time and later asked to contact another reception guy if he can and all such rubbish. They were treating us like doing some favour. While honestly the room were good quality and spacious but the behavior of the staffs there is horrible to ever choose to stay there.,3,Silver Sands Serenity
5550,"ropertyHeman Damania . Group Traveller . Aug 14, 2019We stayed at the hotel for a night. First of all its not a 4 star property. Food menu in the room has limited choice for selection.

Asked the reception to send the bell boy for carrying the luggage but waited 15 mins. Made 3 calls to the reception and no one picked up after that.

5554,Appears that there is no timely maintenance done to the rooms. The room was filled with months of dust under the bed which had to be vacuumed after my insistence. Staff was far from being approachable. They weren’t even ready to acknowledge the fact that things weren’t right. Could clearly see disgruntled staff starting from the Porter to the housekeeping staff and waiters. Wonder who have this hotel 4 star😳. Overall a terrible experience coupled with unfriendly MMDP staff who didn’t even follow up post complaining. That’s the sad part.,1,Silver Sands Serenity

If your kid plays around without touching their any items, they will keep on poking you to take care of the kid, and if you are in cafeteria for breakfast they will ask you to sit outside in hot weather under the sun if your kid is even walking around in the cafe. I had an incident and verbal discussion on this with them regarding rude staff but even the hotel management is not bothered about you. Ratings does matter a lot and I paid the price to ignore it in terms of child friendliness. Not a 4 star property, it's 3 star with worst hospitality.",1,Silver Sands Serenity

The hotel has swimming pool on the terrace. The staff offered decent service but it would be better if they are polished and little more sensitive towards customer service. There are restaurants, ATMs and other utilities nearby. There is Punjabi Rasoi restaurant closeby which served delicious food. There are plenty of bars and wine shops in this area. The other major attractions such as Calngute and Baga are in the range of 4 kilo meters from this hotel and the condition beach is at 10 minutes walk. Two wheelers and 4 wheelers are easily available nearby, you may ask any staff member to arrange the same. Rented 2 wheelers, it is the best mode to explore Goa.

Some basic services which are self-understood by the hotel weren't done even after customer's request like providing water bottles / bathroom clothes + amenities / changing of bed-sheets etc.

5615,I never seen in my life like that worst service. No wifi in my room. After complaint no response Food not that much Worth People not friendly,1,Silver Sands Serenity
5616,The swimming pool is awesome. Bazaar restaurant in-front of the hotel is good you can have food over there. Room clean just the breakfast variety is not that much.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5617,Excellent stay. Swimming pool was under maintenance but still they provide us to swim at there other property exactly behind that hotel. Recommended,5,Silver Sands Serenity

5620,"I mean from hotel location to room quality to infinity pool with a view to breakfast, everything about this hotel was fine. This will be my go-to hotel now and would highly recommend this to friends and family.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5621,"Resort is in candle but away from the main mandolin beach by around 750 meters. This calls for a walk to reach the beach. Our intention was to be at a better resort then nearness to the beach. The room charges are on higher side but completely justifies due to its service, quality of the resort. The room size was on bigger side and makes you feel at home away from home. We just loved it's infinity pool though it's small, we still enjoyed it a much. They have a big parking lot as well. One can sip beer by the pool and order things to eat plus can have hookah. They have a very good restaurant as well called the bazaar which serves very good food and drinks at reasonable prices. Their breakfast spread is OK but I personally did not like the taste much. However the people at the cab jose were very good with service so no complaints as such. I liked their tea and coffee plus option of bread and machine for making toasts. Overall I would recommend to stay at this place and rent a car for travelling to baga, calangute and candolim. A junior suite should be enough for a family of 4 i. 3. 2 kids and 2 adults. Their bed is really big one and I just loved it. You can also visit few beaches in south if you have a day or two additional. Give thumbs up to the review if it helped you.
All was well so no issues as such.",5,Silver Sands Serenity

Rooms are very luxurious and clean.",5,Silver Sands Serenity
5623,The hotel is having very bad air conditioning as well as power supply. I had to struggle for 4 hr to get the AC issue sorted. Every time the staff was saying with in 10 mins the issue will be resolved. Power fluctuate a lot in the rooms. The excuse for bad heating is given this as well as centralized AC. Where in the reception and restaurant is having perfect air conditioning. Staff is OK but for everything they ask for 10 mins and are not punctual and sticking to the time.,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5624,Should not be mentioned as 4 star hotel,2,Silver Sands Serenity
5625,It's very good with a very neat and clean ambiance.,5,Silver Sands Serenity
5626,It was a pleasant experience staying there starting from the guy at reception Elian who was extremely humble and polite and the rooms which were quite spacious.

Then we asked them for cancellation but they said it will be non refundable. After so many conversation with their gm over ph, finally they allotted another room for us. But when we booked it, it was mentioned as Sea view room but there was no Sea view room exists. Breakfast, room interiors, location everything were good. Room check out time is 11am, they can consider for maximum 1hr extra after that they will charge for one day, which was shocking for us since we visit many places and stay various hotels but never experienced this thing. Car service of hotel is excellent with professional driver. Overall average experience.",4,Silver Sands Serenity

The bathrooms are quite modern with all other basic amenities in the room. The hotel is clean and gives a positive feel.

Kudos to them and on top of that they call you early in the morning around 7AM to remind your check-out at 10AM. No plates no glasses available in the room you have to buy your own. Better to stay away from this dormitory!!!!",1,Rivasa Resort
5690,"Though the hotel was a good value for money, there are few things hotel needs to take care. !. Light is not proper in rooms. With just a single 18 watt CFL light in the room, reading was a bit difficult. 2. There needs to be a wall clock in every room. 3. Room service needs to be improved. We were not able to get good quality tea in our room. 4. Check out time must be late or there must be some better provisions for slightly late checkouts as most of the flights to Delhi are late in the evening. Our flight was at 8: 25 pm. we have to leave for airport at 5:00 pm . Early checkout at 10:00am caused a lot of inconvenience to all of us. Though the hotel location is very good, staff is good and polite, hotel management needs to improve on above said points. Dr Sukhdev Maingi MS (Surgery), PS :- Of course buffet breakfast was good , just like home.",3,Rivasa Resort
5691,Hotel location is nice. But room size and height too small. Otherwise hotel is good. pool is good. Staff behavior is so so. Food quality is good. We stayed there for 2 days and overall everything is good and we enjoyed a lot in Anup Holiday Hotel. Nice trip.,4,Rivasa Resort

Second day I asked for early breakfast at 7:30 instead of 8am because I have to rush to reach Railway Station, I felt they took advantage of it and charged me for that breakfast Rs 120/-, as per me I was eligible of complimentary breakfast on that day, this was the point where my experience converted from good to bad about the resort.
Also swimming pool was undermaintance through out my stay.
So when I booked this resort, I thought I am paying this much amount for staying two nights and in return I will get below things:
1- Room accommodation - I get it
2- Wi-Fi services - I get it
3- complimentary breakfast for two days- No I did not get it
4 - Usage of Swimming pool - No I did not get it
This is my experience with the resort on 24th Nov 2016

Once we reached we received a very poor welcome at the lobby as staff very unprofessional as below standard. Staff very inadequate and non courteous with poor standards of service. Breakfast poor. Building and the rooms are in poor condition as look old with its wall paint coming off and ants in the rooms. No bill was given at the time of check out. Only the location was good as advertised.

5719,"It's very painful to have such a pathetic stay while being on holiday you can't ask for more tension if you have chosen this ""so called"" resort for your holidays. Just to give you the glimpse of Their AMENITIES are as follows:- (1) Stinking Rooms. (2) Pathetic. (3) No arrangement for lights even in staircase. (4) Food/Breakfast includes caterpillars and mosquitoes which is a dilemma for vegetarians. (5) Above all a team of staff which doesn't have any pinch of idea as to how to deal with customer. (6) Televisions don't work properly even by staff themselves. Notably This stay was the costliest of all in our long holidays of 10 days.",1,Rivasa Resort
5720,Service was not up to the mark. Rooms were not clean. Food was not that good. Staff was not responding to needs of the customers. Facilities were not provided adequately. No action was taken on complain. Only location is good as it is near to beach.,2,Rivasa Resort

5731,The hotel caters for large groups and this time there was a film crew who were noisy and made sleep impossible. Also they could make an effort to place single guests in rooms away from groups. Also the breakfast was not served until asked. Would not recommend it to foreign guests. Only location was good. Hotel itself was poorly maintained. Towel provided was not absorbent. Bed and air-conditioner was good though. Would advice guests to stay in higher floors if you want a pleasant sleep. Also don't bother with breakfast if you have to pay extra. Nicer food outside and nearby. Check in process is also long winded.,2,Rivasa Resort
5732,"Location is awesome, it is close to calangute beach (within one kilometer radius), and accommodation is also good. Rooms are a bit small as compared to standard size but they are really worth the price paid. Though hygiene could be a problem if you are staying beyond a week.",3,Rivasa Resort

5739,"I just returned from a fabulous weekend at Rivasa Resort Goa. The hotel staff is friendly and the location is awesome. Though the rooms are little short but it gives excellent value for money by proving cleanliness, service and other such facilities like WiFi and swimming pool.",4,Rivasa Resort
5740,Not recommended to any body. Everything is poor in this hotel. Food is not good. Rooms are very small. Light is fluctuating every time. AC is not cooling properly. Height of the roof is only 6-7 feet only. Pool timings are 10 am to 7 pm. Check-in is 12 pm and checkout is 10 am.,2,Rivasa Resort
5741,The hotel has not lift system. And the swimming pool is not clean.,3,Rivasa Resort
5742,Worst experaince ever. Ni service staff so non cooperative and service is worst there and room cleanses is at gods mercy. It is so frustrating my worst hotel experaince so far I would never suggest someone to go for it,2,Rivasa Resort
5743,Very bad. No response. Not good behaviour. Makemytrip value plus hotel I surprise about it. I got a makemytrip kit on last day. I call for shampoo and soap 4 times after they respond me and shampoo is not available in hotel.,1,Rivasa Resort
5744,"The Resort is in a nice place, pretty close to Calangute beach.
Staff are friendly, morning buffet should have a little more variety, Clean rooms, quick response from the reception.
Had a great stay thank You ...",4,Rivasa Resort
5745,"Pathetic service, cleanliness not up to the mark.
Basic toiletries weren't provided, a towel specifically, but when asked, we received the next morning an order to check out before time.
I still can't figure out did they pay for this room That we were placed so bad.",1,Rivasa Resort
5746,Hotel has very few good location rooms. They gave a crappy room in one corner to me. People could see in my room from outside. I had to ask to change the room the next day. Breakfast was ok. Service was ok. Not worth the money they are asking for. Buses line up in parking all night.,2,Rivasa Resort
5747,"Suit room but it was not ready at the time of check in 2-30 PM room was not clean. No intercom, AC was working in one room without remote. Not so interesting only plus point is location. The amount which was paid was very high as compare to room.",3,Rivasa Resort
5748,Worst non air conditioner loe ceiling room.,1,Rivasa Resort
5749,"We were a group of friends looking for a budget accommodation. The best part about the place is the value for money proposition for the basic facilities that it offers and its location. Would not say that the rooms are spanking clean but yes they are clean and decent. A little issue that I had here was with the car parking as the space is less and people end up parking their cars in front of yours. The security fellow will have the car moved in due course but you need to wait till then. I had to get up at 6 am on the first day to move my car as another guest wanted to take out his car. Next I parked my brand new Vento near the entrance (after the experience of having to wake up at 6 am) only to have the bonnet scratched by the bag of some careless guest. The owner Mr. Arvind Desai was courteous enough to show me the CCTV footage of what happened, though I did not claim any damages from him. Not sure if he would have honoured my claim but he was a courteous gentleman and did not act all brash like the locals do when you get into an argument with them. The room that I was staying in had a low ceiling which means the fan was a little low as well. I am 5'10"" and ended up with my hand in the fan while changing aka a bleeding thumb and a bruised index finger at 1230 in the night. Luckily they managed to get an antiseptic (Dettol) with some cotton, bandages and a Relispray. Not all the staff are well informed though as the next day another counter staff had no clue where the first aid kit was.",3,Rivasa Resort
5750,"I visited at 3 AM and I have been given room number 307, room looks like it was store room which was not sure when cleaned last time, bed was broken and room was stinking like anything. Very bad and will never visit the hotel again.",1,Rivasa Resort
5751,"If I m visiting to Goa next time, this won't be the last option even if I don't have any choice. They gave us a room where washroom flush was not working and it was not clean. After requesting they showed us a room where AC not working. After a lot of hassle they provided another room, though the fridge was not working. Power cut was there. They don't have lifts and the suits are on 4th floor. For any kind of service you need to call them again and again. Reception staff are not professional. Only thing good about this hotel is the location. Calangute beach is nearby.",2,Rivasa Resort
5752,"Nice resort, good staff. Swimming pool was good, location is also good, near Calangute and Baga beach. Food quality was good and it was yummy.",5,Rivasa Resort
5753,"Very good hotel to stay with family or couple or with friends, loved this place, recommended for everyone. I would love to visit again, only with one thing I was disappointed of swimming timing. It should be 24 hours. Rest all was good. Thanks to MakeMyTrip. Value for money.",4,Rivasa Resort
5754,We were on short stay but they can improve on better room service,4,Rivasa Resort
5755,"Location wise Rivasa has full points since walk able distance to Calangute Beach. Apart from that it's pathetic. Cleaning for rooms are on request only, breakfast was not having variety and service was at it's worst.",2,Rivasa Resort
5756,The staff is very rude except few. If you ask for any extra service they will simply deny it or will ask for extra money. The breakfast was pathetic and the room is OK types. Swimming pool is not maintained properly. Only location of the hotel was good. You can find much better hotel for the same price.,1,Rivasa Resort
5757,"The hotel restaurant served very tasty food.
There was no lift in hotel. So, staying at third floor was little uncomfortable.",5,Rivasa Resort
5758,"Terrible room service, they really don't care about the service you are supposed to get once you check-in.",1,Rivasa Resort
5759,Overall hotel is nice. I stayed 3 nights here. All staff members are also good accept one lady receptionist known as kavita .. Her behaviour was not good at all .. She had not even not given me room for changing cloth. Instead of changing room she offerd me toilet room .. These was discussing .. Overall for short stay ITIS good,3,Rivasa Resort
5760,"Good hotel, awesome place to stay in Goa . Have fun with friends, value for money,",3,Rivasa Resort
5761,"Location: only one unique thing is that its near to Calangute beach and Baga, Anjuna beach is also approachable. Near to bus stop. Rooms : unclean, smelling, dusty!!! Toilets : unclean, no hot water Facilities: AC not working properly & leaking, lights were very dim, Door was not closing properly.",2,Rivasa Resort
5762,Small room size. Food cost is high. They didn't provide extra mattress because we are group of 5 so booked family room. There is only double coat. Disappointed. Also they charging extra per day for extra mattress.,3,Rivasa Resort
5763,"Rooms were small, but okay for 2 people. AC is not cooling the room as it should be. Immediately closing the AC, results in hot temperature in the room. Swimming pool was under maintenance. Staff at the reception is very helpful and cooperative. Buffet breakfast is good.",3,Rivasa Resort
5764,"Hotel room was smelling bad. Room service is provided on asking basis. Hot water was not there, they provided heater for that it wastes time. Staff was good, helpful.",3,Rivasa Resort
5765,Can go to the place when you cannot find anything else. Not worth the money you put. Rooms are too small.,3,Rivasa Resort
5766,"Excellent location. Calangute beach is walkable from here. Avoid ground floor rooms. Otherwise very good budget hotel. Go for it. Value for money in an area like Calangute beach at Goa, where everything is very expensive. Thanks to MakeMyTrip. Thanks Anup Holiday Homes.",3,Rivasa Resort
5767,"The hotel location is good near to Calangute beach. The room was okay, bit compact but clean. The swimming pool was not clean maybe because of the rain water. One of the room boy was very rude.",3,Rivasa Resort
5768,It was a very simple yet elegant experience. Absolute value for money when booked through MakeMy trip since counter rates are double. Very ordinary hotel with simple amenities but location and value for money are its unique selling point.,4,Rivasa Resort
5769,Rent is high as compare to facility.,5,Rivasa Resort
5770,I feel awesome at this. I recommend everyone at least try at once. During my stay staff was fabulous and I would like to say thanks and I enjoyed there and the location was perfect as per my expectations and food was also good there and I have lots memories.,4,Rivasa Resort
5771,"Location is great and very near to Calangute beach. Breakfast is also very good.
Room was not up to mark. I had to ask for room change due to bad smell in the room. TV was not working properly in rooms. It is average stay and if any body is going then do not expect excellent service.",3,Rivasa Resort
5772,Location and service food good.,1,Rivasa Resort
5773,"Room was not properly maintained and it was a very small room, dressing mirror was broken and no table was there, there was no telephone available and there was no cleaning done till two days as I had to call them. Towels given to us was of a very poor quality. Even food was very average and there was no one to take care of The food.",2,Rivasa Resort
5774,Hotel locality and facilities are good. Hotel service is OK.,3,Rivasa Resort
5775,"The location was very nice, but the they have very few staff for housekeeping and they take lots of time to serve. Also they should add some more choices in a breakfast menu. Their restaurant services is very slow and the taste of food was not happening, finally you will have to end up eating bread butter and tea.",1,Rivasa Resort
5776,"Good for Beach lover, near from the location but hotel room have decent room and fan is not working properly. Complained to reception no one come. Check the room maintains.",2,Rivasa Resort
5777,Room side is too small and low roof is very low.,4,Rivasa Resort
5778,Room cleaning was irregular should be improved,4,Rivasa Resort
5779,"Where do I start from? We were told that there will be running hot and cold water, the cold water did not disappoint but the hot water did because there was no hot water. They had to finally give me a heater to warm the water. I asked for drinking water and the container itself was not clean. The TV placement was not good either. Anyone who wants to check in, check these things. Maybe the other rooms did not have the same problem but my room did. The room was 603.",2,Rivasa Resort
5780,"It was okay, pool was nice. A value for money place. Only thing I did not liked is food was expensive, you can walk for 10 steps and get the same food for 50 percent less. Buffet breakfast had very few options.",2,Rivasa Resort
5781,"Bad resort, in against amount not properly service.
Overall resort is not fine, bad resort, service was too poor.",1,Rivasa Resort
5782,Very Bad Hotel. Room is very bad. Bathroom is very dirty. Hot water is not available in Bathroom. TV is very old. Light Plug is not working. Water Bottle cost is very high. Swimming pool is very dirty. Please don't book this Hotel.,1,Rivasa Resort
5783,Anup hotel is a decent hotel with value for money customers. Its proximity to the beaches is one the USP of the hotel. Also room service is good. They can improve on the beverages they serve; other wise complementary breakfast is a good way to start your day where your dining bills will be high if you eat outside. Small swimming pool is fun after session in sea water.,4,Rivasa Resort
5784,Rooms are different from images shown in Makemytrip. After getting discount on site also room price on the higher side. Staff is not co-operative. When I said about the rooms are small they directly said to complain Makemytrip. I was having two days booking so any how I stayed there for 2 days. On 3rd day I booked another hotel for 1/3 of the price of this hotel. Positive point of this Rivasa is it is near to the beach that's all.,3,Rivasa Resort
5785,Over all the facilities provides were average.,2,Rivasa Resort
5786,"Nearer to sea, worst facilities and no services.
Their no standard room as they showed in website so you have to check reviews and book your room. Choice correct room as rated one not like this resort.",1,Rivasa Resort
5787,This was really a bad experience. Not happy with MMT for ratings. Hotel staff was rude... Not cleanliness. Everywhere smelling badly. We paid 4000 for one room though it was not even worth 2000.,1,Rivasa Resort
5788,Third class room. Food quality is worst,1,Rivasa Resort
5789,"Pathetic one.
*This is a translation of the submitted review.",1,Rivasa Resort
5790,"The main attraction of this hotel is its location which is just 5 minutes walking to Calangute beach and 2 km from Baga beach. Calangute market and restaurant are at walking distance. Breakfast was same for all days so its really pathetic. Room, swimming pool and all other part is fine.",3,Rivasa Resort
5791,I stayed in this hotel for 5 days. It's near to Calangute Beach. Room was little small. Swimming pool was good. Breakfast was also good.,3,Rivasa Resort
5792,Room is very good. Hotel location is near to the calanguate beach distance from hotel and beach is very short. Hotel view is very good. Hotel restaurant food is very nice. Hotel staff was very grandly. Facilities was very good in the hotel. I want to visit in the hotel next time when I plant a trip to Goa.,5,Rivasa Resort
5793,Here facility is such a good. Good breakfast. Staff is to good and helpfull. Enjoyed there. Near by beach. Only 10 min walking distance. Price is worth. And most thanks for makemytrip. In best price best hotel.,4,Rivasa Resort
5794,The location was good. The rooms were not up to the mark. The bathrooms were not all well main tainted. Very bad service provided. Air Conditioner was not working properly. The hotel was a complete disappointment.,2,Rivasa Resort
5795,"Good hotel, nice stay and average food, room was kept neat and clean. Allowed to check in at 11 AM where as it was mentioned in hotel at 12 PM, which was helped us to comfortable to check in when I have reached to the hotel. Swimming pool is average and no restriction in dress code. Overall is good.",4,Rivasa Resort
5796,Very bad place to stay. They allowed girls into pools but won't allow guys. Girls are allowed even after pool timings get over. Service is really poor. There are many more lodges nearby and they all show much better standards. So Anup holiday homes is a bad choice to make.,1,Rivasa Resort
5797,Hotel location is good. Very near to Calangute beach. But room is like small cave. Very dirty. Bathroom is horrible. Very less parking space. Complimentary breakfast has only paratha & poha. If you are looking for beachside nightout then only go for this else its waste of money.,3,Rivasa Resort
5798,Not responding properly very bad experience don't go to this hotel please. Please check other hotels. Don't finalise by seeing hotel photos. The photos are different than reality. They are showing good facilities but providing anything.,1,Rivasa Resort
5799,Nice location but rooms are small .. Staff is cooperative ... Cleaniness is need to improove ... Location is walking distance from calungute beach. And all the markets are near to the hotel ... Finally nice place the Goa is,2,Rivasa Resort
5800,"This hotel located is near by Calangute area, but not the location of lotel is good its like Suffocated still Hotel building is good, But the staff of this hotel is very rude, specially the Admin or Manager what ever that is Very rude, not to manner to talk with guest so please before book this hotel think twice,",1,Rivasa Resort
5801,1. Overall experience was OK OK 2. Room size is very small 3. Renovation work is ongoing currently - faced lot of disturbances. Could not sleep during day time. 4. No room service at all 5. Location is good close to 1 km walk from Calangute beach 6. TV did not work for entire duration.,2,Rivasa Resort
5802,The worst hotel I ever saw. Without any facility. Its return free cancelation .. Its fake No proper rooms .. No service .. No electricity ... Don't even provide water M never gonna book hotel from this site ever .. Worst experience,1,Rivasa Resort
5803,"The rooms were clean and the staff was hospitable and ready to help. The swimming pool was clean and well kept. I have rated it as average because the initial room we were provided Room 107 was really bad. It was very small and compact, the view was nothing great, and the air condition was crazy. It used to start and stop automatically had to keep fumbling for the remote. Also it was really noisy. You do have power cuts and no generator, so keep a torch handy. All this lead to a sleepless night and the lack of sleep dampened the next day. Another day in that room and we would have been ready to move out to a different hotel. After complaining the next day we were moved to a different room that was very good. Spacious, no power cuts, pool view, and an AC that was quite and worked. Overall, I will give it 3 stars. 4 if not for the issues mentioned. The breakfast is okay just the basics bread, butter, jam, sheera, and other vegetarian dishes. Would be an add on if they offered egg or a non vegetarian item as part of the complimentary breakfast. It is close to the beach and has ample parking space for both 2 and 4 wheelers.",4,Rivasa Resort

5805,Very worst hotel in Goa no room service and intercom nothing,1,Rivasa Resort

They don't have free hotel parking space... One has to pay 50rs a day to park a two wheeler and 100 for four wheeler... Complimentary breakfast was never good during our 4 day stay...

They have different room under description family room. The room was on 3 floor no lift in the building. Pool is under construction. The room are too small.. No mirror in one room.

5854,It was a nice stay. The place is very nearby calangute beach which is a point of attraction for the tourists. You can easily manage things late night. The staff is good. Rooms and specially bathrooms are clean.,4,Rivasa Resort
5855,Good stay arrangement. It is a very nice hotel. Staff is quite polite and supportive in every way. Its a value for money we pay. Good place for family stay. Location is very good. Very nearby to the beach. Overall it was a good experience at this hotel. Do try it yourself. Thank you,4,Rivasa Resort
5856,"Well, when we check-in hotel on 4th Feb we faced arrogant staff who does not have courtesy on how to deal with customers. When we entered room the AC was not working hence we changed the room at midnight after making so many request with hotel staff. When we changed to another room AC was working but fridge and Geyser was not working hence we requested staff to correct but it wasn't working though electrician tried to fix it. It was nightmare that we could easily sleep as there were so many mosquitos in room. They provide free breakfast but it is below average and we eat breakfast outside the hotel. I strongly recommend not to go Rivasa resort as its waste of money. It is just looking nice from the outside but not from inside.",1,Rivasa Resort
5857,"This hotel has Worst service, there is no clue of cleaning. Don't go for images showing on site, reality is completely different. Only good thing is location. It is very near to Baga beach and Calangute beach.",1,Rivasa Resort
5858,"The Services provided by the staff is good and Hotel is in good location, rooms are little small but are clean. The Welcome kit they had provided us by MMT is also very nice. There is a large parking space in the parking area of hotel and very good security facilities for vehicles and guest is there in the hotel. Food of the restaurant is not so good.",4,Rivasa Resort
5859,Please don't choose these hotel very poor services. No proper breakfast. Internet is very slow. They don't have any room services person to bring the water. My advise please don't choose these property. My advise is Makemytrip to remove these property from there list.,2,Rivasa Resort
5860,"Location is good just 10 minute walking to Calangute beach. Other beaches are also near by. Food and any other facility is also available near by. Service is slow, you need to remind 2-3 times for any facility. Pool access is provided 9am-5pm that's an issue. Rooms are small but value for money seeing the location. Some renovation is also going on. Wi-Fi is good. Check all amenities when checking-in otherwise change the room, few rooms have small issues related to difference amenities. Allowed 3 hour early check-in and let us keep our luggage after check-out.",3,Rivasa Resort
5861,A traditionally run holiday home. Poor noise insulation from heavy metal playing in adjacent bar. Located near Calangute Beach but does not have sea-view.,3,Rivasa Resort
5862,"Rooms was small but good. Resort location superb, walking distance for Baga beach. Resort staff were very good, restaurant also good with tasty food. We book first time hotel through makemytrip. Superb deal in budget.",5,Rivasa Resort

5865,"Good climate and enjoy a lot have a safe drive have fun in Goa.
Good one and worth of money.",5,Rivasa Resort
5866,1) Did not provide water on time. 2) Single option in breakfast and that was of low quality. 3) No coffee maker available in room 4) Best thing was the location only. 5) No mini refrigerator available at such price which I paid. 6) Overall 1.5/5 because of the location.,2,Rivasa Resort
5867,"Worst experience starting from reception staff to facilities to rooms, only rats and mouse can live here, toilets are like gutters and restaurant and food are not consumable by human being.",1,Rivasa Resort
5868,It is decent hotel. It is very close to beach. The hotel staff is cooperative. Breakfast is pathetic. They kept only one dish and tea/coffee as breakfast which is very unusual. All the required facilities are close by.,2,Rivasa Resort
5869,When we checked in rooms were too small and horrible Ac is not working Fan is not working When we complaint to The desk they ignore us Poor experience waste of money Don't try this hotel Breakfast was average,5,Rivasa Resort
5870,"Worst ever resort I have seen in my life. Rooms are not clean. Water is not good. Inside room some bad smell we felt. Pool is not cleaned. Overall, cleaning problem. Plug points are not working to charge laptop or mobile. Power cut problem. I don't know how makemytrip gave value+ to this worst resort.",1,Rivasa Resort
5871,"Location is awesome. They need to clean the room. And the room which was I offered, the windows locks were broken. So we can't locked the window. Overall stay was good. Need to improve their services about rooms.",4,Rivasa Resort
5872,"Very discourteous staff. Don't know why this hotel is on the panel of makemytrip. Not worth visiting this hotel. Moreover the non refundable tariff is a trap for you. Once you pay advance, you are bound to stay in this hotel.",2,Rivasa Resort
5873,"Receptionist heard you out patiently and were polite it doesn't matter your problem is resolved or not. Even after informing multiple times, they have not arranged rooms in same floor. The swimming pool was very unclean, it's provided just to attract the online customers. There is sitting space at the center of hotel looks good in pictures but there is no ventilation, so you won't sit there. Every room had at least 1 problem. Lights were dim in some rooms, AC was non controllable, fan was missing. I mean wall fan, there is no space for ceiling fan, telephone missing, each time you have to personally visit the reception, non working cable, unclean wardrobe, etc. Personally checked around 10 rooms and ended up with no telephone. Room's height is only 7 feet and you end up hurting yourself at door entrance and toilet entrance every time. The only toiletry provided was a small soap. Tap water provided for drinking in rooms. Dirty drinking water on every table. On complaining they removed it from my table but had to tell them again to remove from other tables as well. Rodents, cockroaches at buffet counter. The explanation for this was this time the pest control was delayed. If the customer becomes sick, they may safely blame on change of weather. The breakfast options were bread, jam, butter, tea, cornflakes, two breakfast item. The utensils in restaurant as well as in rooms were very unclean, needed to clean again personally before using it. While complaining to the counter realized that they knew they have bad rating but who cares. MakeMyTrip should work on there also on identifying the hotels as well as the rooms category. I was wondering on what basis the hotel received average grating. Is the standards diluted.",1,Rivasa Resort
5874,Don't stay this hotel very poor service,2,Rivasa Resort
5875,"I checked out one day before on 10th Oct, room was worst, small not having place to put extra bed for kids.no cleaning till my stay 3 day. My dustbin was smailing. Reception, room boy cleaning all staff unprofessional.",1,Rivasa Resort

5877,Tv was not working. Ac cooling too high. Room was too small. Make my trip customer care number given in voucher does not exist. Both of u and hotel were of no help. My overall trip experience was terrible due to poor help,1,Rivasa Resort
5878,"ily Traveller . Oct 08, 2016Not Up To the mark.. Very dirty rooms. Food quality is also bad... Worst experience ever. Very bad room condition. Very fuddu bed in very small rooms like store. Very bad pool for swimming. Not even any single room is without smell and insects mosquitos bedbugs... Even not having good toilets.",2,Rivasa Resort
5879,"The resort is not matched up to quality and standard. Service and housekeeping is pathetic. Rooms are not as it is appears in the picture. Free breakfast is mentioned which is even worst then not having anything, because it is not worth for a resort in Goa. Customer value is last for them.",2,Rivasa Resort
5880,"This hotel letting down the image of makemytrip. Room is untidy, swimming pool was not cleaned properly, it's not an hotel only just a guest house. We were not expecting makemytrip offer such a bad hotel.",2,Rivasa Resort
5881,Thanks to MakeMyTrip for arranging our visit. The hotel was booked at very discounted and competitive price. The hotel location is very-very good. All good restaurants and nearby taxi services are just few steps away from hotel. Calangute Beach is just walking distance (10 minutes). Good markets are very nearby. Very good value for money. Over all the experience was very good. We got buffer breakfast complementary from MakeMyTrip and it was very good. However some flaws like on first day we were provided very good room but second day when many people arrived in the hotel the service got affected drastically. Also the room is just sufficient for two people. If you have habit of staying in spacious halls then better take some other hotel. Also there was no food arrangement for even dinner. But all these things donÂ’t make any difference because of its great location. Highly recommended to book this on MakeMyTrip who are look value for money.,4,Rivasa Resort
5882,Nice hotel. Room was medium quality. Hotel is not on the beach but very close and walk-able. Better place for family compared to guest houses. Considering that in Goa most of the time is spent outside and not in room it was a good hotel.,4,Rivasa Resort
5883,Beautiful place for beautiful people,5,Rivasa Resort
5884,"Description of the resort in photos and the original resort is not as same as we think, maintenance is not up to mark, beds was very bad getting noises from other room, no hot water facility, cockroaches on bed.",3,Rivasa Resort

5887,"This hotel is not good for tourists.
Not comfortable hotel for costumer.",1,Rivasa Resort
5888,"Hotel management is very inefficient and not capable to handle customer needs. They have given me 3 STD AC rooms with lots of problems in all rooms. My first day is very horrible with no hot water, TV channel not working, every 5 minutes electricity gone, no DG set, poor house keeping, no response from reception. Next day no water for Bath, take 1 bucket of water for Bath. Breakfast quality is very poor, I request you to do not make payment to resort and kindly refund my payment as well as hotel have to apologise for inconvenience cause to my family. Whole experience is very bad with resort.",1,Rivasa Resort
5889,Rooms are good and location is good. The worst thing is that hotel is charging for extra child even though you don't take extra mattresses. We stayed three days with two children and payed for one extra mattress but they charged for second child also.,4,Rivasa Resort
5890,"Hi, I stayed in standard AC room, startng from the good things about the hotels I will move to the things which I disliked, so about the location its few minutes walk away from Calangute beach, staff is very generous and ready to help in any case, room service is good staff is very friendly they will always greet you with smile, room condition was average in case of our rooms door size was very small a normal 5feet 5 inch guy can hit the top if not bend himself, rooms were clean AC was working fine. Door locks need to be replaced. Every time we had to call room service guys to open them. We had food only once but quality of food was decent. Overall good hotel in budget price. Or a bit overprice if I must say. Thanks for Reading",3,Rivasa Resort
5891,"Small but functional rooms. Enough for 2 but little smaller than expected. We were in the deluxe. Room service was non existent and we stayed for 3 nights with no service in the rooms. We returned each evening to find the room in the exact condition we left it in. Can't expect much as we did not pay super high amount for this hotel. It's far from a resort. Just that it has a small swimming pool so maybe that counts towards it being a resort. I don't know. I also asked for an iron since some clothes were wrinkled in travel but the reception did not have one. Also, the front end is nice and helpful, but I was unhappy knowing they did not have an iron, after all it was a resort and not a BnB.",3,Rivasa Resort
5892,"No comment all things are so bad, apart of location hotel is near of beaches, that's a good thing. Rooms conditions so bad facilities. Nothing to say. Don't go with family. If you go single that's take care of yourself but I suggest there have nice hotel.",1,Rivasa Resort
5893,We stayed from 14th march to 16th march it was a pleasant stay. Thanks for MakeMyTrip for a good deal. Hotel is ok for this rate and having a small swimming pool. And hotel staff behaviour is good. Overall good experience. Good stay at rivesa hotel.,4,Rivasa Resort
5894,Best hotel location vise good food clean swimming pool but satisfactory services.,5,Rivasa Resort
5895,Small room. Frequent power down. Poor food. Rude staff. Only location is good. No WiFi. Lot of mosquitos. No parking. Swimming pool very small. Dirty water. Dirty mattress and bed. I cancelled my booking. Stayed only one night,2,Rivasa Resort
5896,One of the least maintained hotel I have been to. The staff and front desk are not apt to handle tourist. Rooms not properly cleaned. The rooms were not given ass promised as they were overbooked. The front desk was not capable enough to handle tourist.,2,Rivasa Resort
5897,"It's average, good facilities specially morning breakfast.",5,Rivasa Resort
5898,Very neat rooms very near from beach swimming pool was neat and clean great staff food was also good and he room service was very helpful Also would recommend for all my family friends to stay here as the place is very huge and very near by to the beach. Overall great experience,5,Rivasa Resort
5899,The hotel location is excellent. Near to market. It central place to all the main beach Calangute and bags beach. Room are comfortable. The hotel is in expanding. Near 100 rooms are available here. Overall rating average.,3,Rivasa Resort
5900,"The hotel was not maintained. The room used to smell and they didnt have any room freshener. When I asked for the same, I got no response from them. There was no facility for purified drinking water; there was no aquaguard there in the hotel.",3,Rivasa Resort
5901,Location was good near to the Calangute beach. Housekeeping was zero as we informed him to clean the room but they do not do that. Main thing is that if you are in Goa in this season than how much time you will spend in hotel so not a bad choice in budget hotel.,3,Rivasa Resort
5902,"Located close to Calangute (walking 10 minutes) and Baga (driving 5 minutes) beach. Easy to find out the location.
Check in & Check out is smooth and satisfactory.
Complementary breakfast is good quality.
AC & Cable TV satisfactory.
Swimming pool available, though currently closed for maintenance.
Even OK for family stay.
Staff is fine and decent. However you have to remind for change of towels and soap.
Overall experience is average for business traveler like me, but certainly value for money and five star rating for location. Surely would like to visit again if needed.",3,Rivasa Resort
5903,"Tap was not working .. Room keys were not working ... Only location is good as it is nearer to colangute beach ... Overall hospitality is not good .. If anyone who wants to stay nearer to beach, it will definitely be good choice",2,Rivasa Resort
5904,Room are too old. AC not working properly. Hot water facility is not available. But aiming pool is best and breakfast is not good. As we think for the hotel. Location wise hotel is too much good near all the best beaches.,5,Rivasa Resort
5905,The hotel is good if you just want to come back for sleep and get ready. Room was not having proper lights and air circulation. Don't ever order tea/coffee while you stay there. It is only good if you don't want to waste much money on your stay.,3,Rivasa Resort
5906,"Not best but good hotel to stay at Calangute, Goa. I stayed for two days with my family, all staff were very polite. Location was very good, but room size is very small and the height of rooms are very low. But still we enjoyed a lot over there specially the swimming pool. Guys if you are planning your vacation at Calangute hotel then this hotel is the right choice in low budget.",4,Rivasa Resort
5907,"Very poor facility and hospitality. Hotel staff are so arrogant and not supportive. Electrical problem, lights off for more then a night during stay at this hotel. So many mosquitos in room. Breakfast must have more option. Room ceiling are very low if you are 6 feet hight you head will touch the ceiling. Overall bad experience and not worth for money.",1,Rivasa Resort
5908,"Hotel was overall good. But need to improve Room's interior. It was not properly furnished and Ventilated.
There was no proper lighting in room, Just small CFL Bulb. Its good enough for youngsters guys to make their trip into Budget.",3,Rivasa Resort
5909,This was the first time I booked a hotel through makemytrip at Goa. I booked this based on the reviews listed on the website. I stayed for 3 nights and 4 days from Dec 25 to Dec28. And this is my review here Negatives first: - the room i was given was very small so the first look did disappoint me very much. - there was not even a stand to put clothes or any table to place anything - the swimming pool is too small mostly meant for kids donÂ’t go by the pictures on the website - there is no restaurant at the hotel - felt a bit costly for the size of the room - also ask for a bigger room other rooms are better for the same category positives: - great location walk able distance from Calangute beach - all the good hotels are very near by for food - room service is good and staff is also very cooperative - would recommend for others also except for the cost factor.,4,Rivasa Resort
5910,"Location of the hotel is very nice, walking distance from Calangute beach also the market is at walkable distance. The staff of the hotel is cooperative. Rooms are clean but hot water is not available 24 hrs. Breakfast is typical indian which is also nice. We are satisfied the hotel.",4,Rivasa Resort
5911,Best location near Calangute beach. Walkable distance to beach from hotel. Value for money. Hotel rooms are good .. Hotel staff's behaviour is also good. Overall good experience with Rivasa ...,3,Rivasa Resort
5912,We booked 3 rooms checking at 4. But there was issues in their wiring so no power we stayed in 1 room for few hours they allotted different rooms around 10 it was stinky not at all clean. Bathrooms are worst few glasses are broken and not at all clean. There is leakage in rooms.. Worst stay..,1,Rivasa Resort
5913,This hotel location is good near market and all beaches. services not good. Average paisa vasool. Breakfast like and all services average or itne kam m kya milega room acha and bathroom ki or room small and enjoy this hotel and Goa.,3,Rivasa Resort
5914,Hotel is under re construction. Rooms are very small and not very good. Electric fittings are not fitted properly. Swimming pool is dry and under repair. Although have a very good restaurant ( bay leaf) with delicious food.,1,Rivasa Resort
5915,Terrible hotel. Low ceiling room was booked without information. Though hotel staff was awesome.,2,Rivasa Resort
5916,"The person we met at the reception in the morning of our arrival at the hotel was very rude. After the rescheduling of our stay at the hotel, met the manager and he was very obliging. No toiletries such as towels are not kept leave alone soap, shampoo or other small things which is normally given in hotels of this standard. Overall the stay was pleasant.",3,Rivasa Resort
5917,Worst hotel. Very bad experience. They don't take care of their services. I have spent 3 nights and 4 days. They don't clean the room not even a single time. Services are very poor. They don't provide any Utensils while eating. It's a under construction hotel. So lot of disturbance was there. I will not suggest anyone for this hotel and make my trip.,1,Rivasa Resort
5918,I had a worst experience in this Hotel. Please do not stay in this hotel. The rooms are very congested and the service is very bad. There was no ventilation. It was uncomfortable to stay in ground floor as every one can see you from out side. I had very bad experience.,1,Rivasa Resort
5919,It was a nice hotel. Location very near to Calangute Beach. Hotel staff is also co-operative with us. The pool is also very clean and there is 5 beach near from Rivasa resort and market is also near from the resort and near to railway station and airport also you can find out vegetarian hotels also from the rivasa resort.,4,Rivasa Resort
5920,"I didn't like the behavior of staff, they don't even provide a single plate from their side. They just tried to confuse customer.",2,Rivasa Resort
5921,"The hotel is placed near Calangute beach, it has a nice swimming pool, however, the rooms with low ceilings have some issue or another one was damp, the air conditioner was not working in the other.
The room was damp, otherwise nice location. I believe that the problem is with the low ceiling rooms.",3,Rivasa Resort
5922,Hotel staff needs to be more professional. Few of them are really good specially the newly joined electrician guy from Bihar but rest are all below average. Need more cleanliness and the person at night reception is not helpful at all. I asked for some ice in one evening and he replied it's not available since adjacent restaurant is too close. I smiled and asked for the same on the next day just to check and he replied it's not available. It seems that he is always ready to make some excuse whatever you ask for without even trying to get it. I am not sure why they treat like customer as an idiot. Anyway I guarantee no one will be back to book their hotel for the second time in their life and the management seems to be happy with it.,1,Rivasa Resort
5923,Breakfast is not upto The mark. Not much of variety. And quality of food is not even average. Location is perfect. Rooms are good. House keeping is perfect. Swimming pool was below average as water was not getting filtered as motor was not working. Overall location and rooms are above average. And rest all is below average.,4,Rivasa Resort
5924,This hotel is located near the Calungute Beach and is a very decent option to stay at. Would recommend this to others.The hotel staff is helpful and friendly. Hotel has a swimming pool with only draw back being that the water of the pool always remains chilling as direct sunlight never falls on it.,4,Rivasa Resort
5925,"The worst experience we ever had in a room
*No AC
*TV Without any network
*Power cuts
*walls with lots of path holes
*not so clean rooms
Guys never ever prefer these rooms the staff is irresponsible, no phone in room to communicate for the basic needs like soaps & towels .. Etc you can c the situation of the rooms attached below",2,Rivasa Resort
5926,"Average facility, it's okay to stay for one day hold.",3,Rivasa Resort
5927,The staff was very helpful and even gave us 1 hour early check in and 1 hour late check-out. The pool was nicely maintained and the services were great for the money we spent. The place is at walking distance from calangute beach and that's the major advantage.,3,Rivasa Resort
5928,"Rooms and Location is good! Walking distance from Calangute Beach!
The best part of this hotel is location and the complimentary breakfast!
The bad part is arrogant staff, who are not so guest friendly!",4,Rivasa Resort

receptionist kumar was not a polite person, i don't why are do they need such pathetic person. Breakfast is to terrible we felt like a begger, don't do the breakfast here. I paid 1800rs for airport drop and asked for ertiga but eventually they gave me wagon r. Very cheap people

5933,Overall it was an awesome hotel to stay in.,5,Rivasa Resort
5934,Never want to book this hotel at rs. 3000. Very bad experience never book this hotel. Image of restaurant on web is excellent actual position is different than imagination. I request all tourists not to book this hotel.,3,Rivasa Resort
5935,"If you are planning to book this hotel, please abort the mission right away! My dream of a happy and high breezy life at Goa was marred by this hotel. I was impressed to see the hotel to look so good from the inside, but like they say don't judge the book by it's cover. Do not judge the hotel by it's pictures. The rooms ended right where I stepped in. A dinghy, small room with a bathroom with no basic amenities. Bathroom with a ventilator made specially for curious passersby would stop and peep in for their leisure. Water Jar left empty for the tourists to fill them up for themselves. Not much is expected from a decent budget hotels however, basic amenities definitely are there.",2,Rivasa Resort
5936,"Location was awesome near to beaches .. Baga and anjuna. It will take only 10 minutes to reach Baga and for anjuna it will take 20 minutes .. So awesome location this hotel have, I just loved this hotels location.",3,Rivasa Resort

5938,. Please don't stay in this hotel ... Highly unhygienic. Staff rude. Rooms are very Small and bed was broken. Swimming pool very dirty. Not worth staying in this hotel. Restaurant service is also poor. Waste of money.,1,Rivasa Resort
5939,Hotel is at best place to stay but need lot of improvements in services. Excellent food. Swimming pool is too small and wifi not worked which they offer also they do not have sufficient staff to prompt services for the visitors. Thus it is costly then they offer services to the visitors.,3,Rivasa Resort
5940,"It is not look like shows by you. It is very old resort, not maintained properly. Bracket quality was also not good. Safety is also doubtful in this resort. This stay is worst experience in my life till now.",1,Rivasa Resort

5942,Breakfast was very poor. Smell of toilet around the gallery. 15 watt cfl provided in room glowing like night bulb. Tea was not provided on demand at 6.30 pm.,2,Rivasa Resort
5943,"Staff were excellent, breakfast was good, staff serving breakfast was really nice and gave an excellent service. Location of hotel also is nice. Away from the main road, so quieter.",5,Rivasa Resort
5944,"Bad experience no hot water, rooms very small, no drinking water glass in room, overall very bad experience.
Only hotel location very good.
And breakfast is very good. Please any one do not go rivassa resort not worth in money",1,Rivasa Resort
5945,"Initially we got 2 rooms in which the AC was in a very bad condition. They tried to repair it but the problem was not solved. When requested, they denied me another room. But Make My Trip team intervened and we got 2 other rooms and after that the stay was very comfortable and cool. The service was also good. The most important point is its swimming pool which was clean and obviously its location.",4,Rivasa Resort
5946,This is a good place for a vacation. They have a restaurant. The food is good but the service is slow. They have a parking place for two wheeler vehicles. The only issue is when there is rush during peak weekends you need to come in early as the best rooms are booked.,4,Rivasa Resort
5947,Service not upto your standard. Needs revamp.,3,Rivasa Resort
5948,"I would like to tell you that do not go for this hotel. If you want to relax and enjoy hotel stay, definitely this is not the place you are looking for. This hotel is having lots of disadvantages like:- 1. The hotel is under poor maintenance. I got first room in which AC was not working and it was having lots of mosquitoes. Its bathroom door lock was also not working. I somehow managed to change room but extension was not working. TV remote was not working. 2. Extremely Small Size rooms:- When they say standard ac rooms means its hardly 10 by 12 feet. Once double bed and luggage is put in this room you do not have any place to move. 3. No maintenance of swimming pool and hotel rooms. No shower before entering swimming pool, no life guard. No care is taken to keep water clean. 4. Care less staff at reception:- Staff at reception is very care less. You have to approach several times for your issue. They will never give proper response. 5. Poor restaurant:- This is the most frustrating point. This hotel doe not have its own restaurant. There is one hotel (Wind and Dine) which is affiliated to this. Hotel has arranged breakfast at this restaurant. Do not expect much in breakfast. Every day they will have only one item like pav-bhaji or chole-pav or uttapa-sambhar. Strange thing is they offer machine tea and coffee. Do not accept that you will get lots of dishes like poha-umpa-bread omelette-fruit dishes-juices-edli sambar-dosa sambar. Most frustrating is nothing is tasty and cost is too much. Dal khichdi is Rs. 270. Aloo paratha is Rs. 100 and tea is Rs. 40. But unfortunately nothing is tasty. If we gave some order and ask manager to add in your room bill so that it can be calculated/settled on last day.. They will simply refuse and tell that hotel and restaurant is not connected. I was with my family and small kids. I found difficult to get proper food for my kids. 6. Very odd infrastructure:- Once you enter in passage and heading towards your room, you will find beams at a height of 5 feet 8 inches. So person having height of 5 feet 8 inches (5 feet 7 inches) cannot walk with straight neck. He has to bend often as you will get 4-5 beams like this. This becomes more problematic if you are carrying heavy luggage or your kids are with you. More surprise is when you enter room, roof is at a height of 6 feet. You can easily touch roof. This is the reason this hotel does not have ceiling fan, but they are using table fan. 7. Lots of mosquitoes:- Every day you will have to ask for Hit for killing mosquitoes. 8. Poor WiFi:- WiFi is not available in rooms. It is available in reception or in pool area. But reception is always full of people and you do not have place to sit and browse. I did not find WiFi speed up to mark. 9. Discrimination:- During my visit, I had seen some foreigners as well and hotel staff is paying more attention to them and ignoring us as if we have not paid anything. Over all its a flop hotel and no one should go to this hotel. If just location is a key point for this hotel then I will suggest there are many good hotels in the same lane.",2,Rivasa Resort

Rooms are so dirty blanket and sheets are filthy and washroom so so unhinged. When we went for breakfast nothing was there no breads, no butter, no options for juice, no fruits nothing. And then after our check-out when we come back to hotel to take our bags then we asked for lobby washroom they gave key of occupied washroom. And when we complained of this people least bother to listen. Worst hotel..",2,Rivasa Resort

As our check in time was 12:00 pm but guest were asked to wait they were least bothered to adjust to accommodate before time. It was told we can give rooms after 11:00 am. Not only this we were shown 2 rooms which were very small as per our bookings also it was so untidy and smelly. I would recommend not to stay along with family members. Better to stay at a place where you to pay a a penny more but your family members don't face such problems.",3,Rivasa Resort

No drinking water supply to rooms or tea kettle is available for preparing tea though the cost is around Rs. 2000/- per night. There is no Wi-Fi connectivity. Hardly it catches for any mobile. You are requested to look into such matters before recommending for stay of guests.

5978,"Excellent location, food quality was good",5,Rivasa Resort
5979,We were reached at hotel at exact check-in time for non- AC room. Most disappointing thing is they took 1:30 hour to provide us room.

Ordering food from the restaurant is the worst thing you can do, you'll get your tea cold in like 30 minutes of ordering and the most funniest thing was they take 20 minutes to deliver 2 water bottles there are hell of a things to complaint which I can't write down and get frustrated thinking about those. Overall it was a pathetic experience staying here.",1,Rivasa Resort

One can imagine how hard it is to sleep with that smell of mosquito coil in the room. I booked two rooms here. One of the AC made murmuring sound all the time. When asked to look into this, a guy came and just hit hard on it a couple of time. It stopped making sound for some time and then even got worse. In another room, AC was throwing more of cold water than cold air.",3,Rivasa Resort

6003,It was a cheap stay near Calangute beach. It costs each of us 800 per person per night. There were problems with water heater and some facilities. But if you are okay with less facilities then go for this hotel. Breakfast provided by hotel is very good in taste and quality.,3,Rivasa Resort

6006,Very very bad service.,1,Rivasa Resort
6007,I travelled with my wife in first week of January 2015. It was more than I expected in such a price. Its very close to the prime beaches like Baga and Candolim. I took a standard air-conditioned room which was very clean and tidy. Bed-sheets and towels were like new. Bathroom was also clean. It had a small balcony too with hanging stand and a laundry basket. What else you can expect in budget price in the peak season in Goa. It has a good parking space too. It has a small swimming pool which was cleaned everyday. But once you are in the city of Ocean there is no need of a pool atleast for me. The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a nice and clean hotel close to the prime location this is for you.,4,Rivasa Resort
6008,"Budget hotel, breakfast is good but has limited choice but it's really good. Swinging pool is good but they should keep clean. Location is major plus factor for The hotel. The only drawback is that they charge extra for pick-up and drop and for early check-in even if rooms are vacant.",3,Rivasa Resort
6009,Food is good but most of the time dishes as per menu are not available. Breakfast menu needs improvement. Response time should be reduced.

6067,"It was a very small room not for 3 persons and also not sufficiently illuminated. Staircases were very dirty, even pungent smell was coming from everywhere. Ordering food is a big problem as the service boys will reach in half an hour after the call. If you are staying upstairs, for card payments need to visit the reception. Breakfast was average in taste and at the restaurant down stairs.",3,Rivasa Resort
6068,"Good to stay at hotel. But its better if we had daily house keeping. Its value for the money that we spent and breakfast is also not bad, if we want hygienic, we can go with the bread and jam.

Breakfast was very poor quality.",3,Rivasa Resort
6070,"Hotel staff was very co-operative. But room provided to us was very short in height 6 ft. Entrance of room was less that 5.6 ft. All facilities were good except their room size. Complementary breakfast was provided by their restaurant, which was average. Normal rate of food in that restaurant was of any 3-4 star hotel in Goa. Travel desk is also not so much co-operative, rather they try to sell their tour/ taxi package only. However room service and reception staff were very co-operative.",4,Rivasa Resort

6086,JAIN food not available. Breakfast timings not set as per sight seeing timings.,4,Rivasa Resort
6087,Overall okay because of location from beach was awesome but other facilities made it feel like we have taken okay hotel.

6095,Location of the resort was classic. But in comparison with a standard resort specially for Goa location was not upto mark. Rooms are too small to accommodate the bed only. There is no space in room. Cupboards bad. Bathrooms are bad. TV was outdated one. For service no one came back or called. Given me the room which was at corner back side wherein all beer bottles are dumped. Requested for change hopefully they changed it. In breakfast they had given sliced bread. Pathetic service. Good for those who wants stay at around Rs. 1500-1800. Above that it is not worth for money.,3,Rivasa Resort

After telling them it's not acceptable they got a room cleaned and shifted us. THere was no water available, no room service available. There was no toilet paper. Next day in order to get my room cleaned and sheets and towels changed i have to tell them 5 times and personally go 2 times. Still it happened after 10 hours. Absolutely pathetic experience. Not recommended.",2,Rivasa Resort

Pros - The resort is nearby Calagunte beach and is absolute value for money hotel. You get quality food at reasonable price at the restaurant (bay leaf) and complementary breakfast. It also has mini swimming pool, WiFi and AC rooms.
Cons-The room didn't have lights, so at the time of check in we had to request for lights, the next day there was no hot water for Bath but next two days we got hot water after request.
Overall- Visit this place if you want good rooms without burning your pocket as it provides most of the facilities mentioned at a reasonable cost.",4,Rivasa Resort
6106,Only Pool is good. Rest everything is just bad I can say. And hotel staff are very uncooperative and rude.,3,Rivasa Resort

6108,"Needs lot of improvement in room comfort, basic amenities in the room, breakfast menu etc. Breakfast should start by 06.30 hours onward for the guests to utilize their time effectively.

6109,Just location is good. Very near to beach but on main road. Swimming pool was not clean. Rooms are too small. Bathroom were old fashioned. Food was average. Cleanliness was average. Most important thing is room was small. Try to book online that may offer better deal.,3,Rivasa Resort

I would recommend this hotel for you.",4,Rivasa Resort
6124,"Location was OK OK only good thing was it was 3-4 km away from The Beach. Food was good but expensive.
I disliked The most that we can not carry out Side food when even in The 4 to 5 hotels they allow. They were checking The bags and were charging extra money which I don't think that a hotel should do, that they should be purely leaving up-to The choice of The customer, if they like they will have from outside. There were cockroaches in The rooms which looked untidy. This is The major drawback cos of which I will never opt for this hotel again.",2,Rivasa Resort

They haven't provided room services in spite of requesting thrice. Budget stay but could have been better. Don't expect much ..!",3,Rivasa Resort
6130,"The most interesting part in Goa trip is beaches. Anup Holiday Homes is just 10 min walkable distance from Calingute Beach so its very easy to go to beach at any time.

1. The water was dripping from the ceiling. We were shifted to the other room which again had leakages.
2. Staff is very rude. Do not know how to talk to people and behave decently.
3. Room service is pathetic. If you go down to the restaurant the order comes at least after an hour.
4. Same is the case with the room service. Once ordered you have to call 10 times to check the status of your order.
5. The staff didn't even bother to clean the room in our 3 days stay.
6. They don't have enough staff. And the people even at the reception there are extremely rude.
7. I am sorry to say but such hotels should not be there on MakeMyTrip as it will lead to doubts in customers for future bookings.
Please visit the resort at your own risk as it is not at all worth the price. I would personally not recommend anyone to go to this place and spoil their stay in Goa.",1,Rivasa Resort

It's located very near to calangute beach which is in north Goa and accessible from most of the locations. Plus a safe place for girls to stay. It cost us around 800 rs per head for per day.

6164,"I have travelled in more than 300 districts in India. But I did not find so horrible hotel so far. I had booked total 4 rooms for our group. The hotel entrance is very good. But inside everything is not good at all. The rooms are very small. I had booked a room for 3 persons by paying almost 70% extra amount. But there was hardly any space for the 3rd person's mattress. It was literally folded. Rooms were a good accommodation of cockroaches and. I was shifted to other room. But other room was not different. Ladies of our group went to restaurant. There was one cook and one waiter to serve them. They took 2 hours to have some food. The hotel does not offer hot water if there is not sunshine as they have solar water system. It was a cloudy day when I stayed. There was not manager at counter in the morning. The fellow available at counter told me that hot water will be available after 900. At 900, he simply said. No Sunshine No hot water. Nothing can be done... Except location, which is very close to Calangute beach, it is horrible hotel as of today... I spent over Rs 1800.

Toilet dirt not getting flushed... It was coming back in comod.. Neither of our complaints were responded on time or resolved on time... We never got our room exchanged by these people either they were refunding our booking money... Pathetic food at Restaurant... Break fast as like they are giving you at free of cost... Tea and coffee is machine made... If you ask for fresh tea or coffee you have to lay for it... Reception people are full of arrogance While check out reception people may charge you for damages that you never made... We have experienced same for color damage, which we never made. They charged us 600/-per towel for replacement cost of towel... As we never made those damages, we denied for same. These people called bouncer at security and threatened and made us pay amount... I would suggest book this if you like inconveniences, toilet break down... And mainly if you have extra money to pay damages that you never made... Not good for Family booking... Theft security is not trustworthy... Poorest service of all time in Goa...",1,Rivasa Resort

Stay only if you have to sleep, stay in night in a cheaper option else it's poor. Check-in time is 1200 hrs and check out is 1000 hrs not even 24 hrs. The hotel gives you an hour grace time.

Hotel is situated only 8 km from the main city but the charges to reach there are exorbitant.

Rooms are nice and clean. Though bathrooms are missing exhaust fans. Also, less options for food in walking distance of hotel (if you want to try something different).

They won't barter it for a kf ultra, even if you surrender your bucket for one pint. They advertise that they give you a complimentary bike, which is not true. They, at best, give you the number of the bike fellow complimentary. The location is very remote, don't even think of this resort if you are not hiring a cab from airport to airport. Rooms are just about OK. The best part is their bed linen, which is clean and comfortable. Their rooms are dimly lit, and corridor smells. The bathroom is clean, just that water flow is very low. Towels are rough and overused. Facilities- swimming pool was unclean, and ill maintained. Facilities include one tt table. Gym is well equipped for a hotel of this category.
There was no sound proofing in the room, I could hear toilet flushing of other rooms as if it was of my own room. Bathroom shower flow was very week, people shouting and yelling outside disturbed sleep.",1,Rendezvous Beach Resort

Thanks.",4,Ocean Palms Goa
6688,Hotel service was good and best hotel to stay.,5,Ocean Palms Goa
6689,"This hotel is located 2 Km from Calangute Beach, slight near to the main connecting road by way of an alley. Outside view is not good as there are buildings all round the hotel. Hotel staff overall are not well trained and don’t seem to care much for travelers comfort and requirement. Hotel has a wired policy of not allowing guests in rooms even office colleagues. I tried to go to my room with one of my colleague (male) for an hour for discussions but the hotel front office staff and the manager refused to let us go. Rooms are good in size but average in terms of overall upkeep. Toiletries are also not of good quality. Food is average. Buffet not available everyday. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,Ocean Palms Goa
6690,"I booked hotel through MMT for 2 days from 17 to 19th Oct. On the checking day (actual time is 2pm) but due to train late we reach hotel at 7. 30pm. They show me 2 rooms but that room is small bathroom is also congested. I talked to reception on website room pics are different and here is different why? They said next day you can get better room if rooms are vacant. So 1st day of stay is not satisfactory. As per my knowledge don't shift the newly constructed rooms they are very small in size. Same category rooms in reception building is better than newly constructed rooms. Next day we shifted in another room just upper to reception building .. That is very good and well managed. Breakfast is also very good with lots of variety. From 2nd day stay on words we feel value for money hotel in all terms such as location, near by market and 2 beaches is around 2 km in range. 1st day we faced a problem. Overall I can rate this hotel 4. 5 out of 5",5,Ocean Palms Goa

6861,"So we had visited for nights in Goa and as it was off season still we enjoyed, hotel is right in middle of the main market 10 minutes away from a beach, there are no shacks on that beach but its still good for enjoying the view. Breakfast was good, they did have variety juices and 2 live chef special items by ordering the chef to make it in front of you. We booked palm rooms but after two days they wanted some maintenance work to be done in that building so they upgraded us to suite rooms and that was humongous also they gave us 2 suite rooms as we were family of 6 and they opened the partition door between those two rooms and it was like wowww 3 balconies 4 split acs 4 tvs room service blah blah what not, staff was cooperative room service was quick and obviously playing area was also a great thing to time pass and fun.

6864,"We stayed for 4 days. The room was comfortable and well made. In fact the hotel upgraded our rooms at no additional cost, perhaps as we went off season. The breakfast was great and the choice for veg food was good, non-veg however was little lacking. However, the restaurant staff was willing to prepare the food as per our liking. There is a good swimming pool and a few recreation activities. The best part of the stay was the courteous staff and the service they provided. They ensured that rooms were neat and clean, coffee and tea supplies were available, helped us settle down when we got there and in general made sure our stay was pleasant. Check-in and checkout was absolutely quick and smooth too. Location wise the place is close to Calangute Beach but still needs short ride or drive, 1-2 km. It is not walk-able in the hot sun though. There are plenty of food joints around within walk-able distance. Good place if you are a foodie like me. Has a good supermarket nearby in case you missed bringing something along. The one downside is that the locating the hotel first could be challenge. It is a inside from the main road and board is not clearly visible. My recommendation is to use the GPS and follow directions. I did that and therefore was able to find the location. Overall, I give it a big high five for this hotel.",5,Ocean Palms Goa

Hotel front office manager continuously called on intercom and knocked the door for every 5-10 minutes and asking my visitor to leave from the property. When we spoke to front office manager with little high voice, he actually said ""Shut up "" and asked us to check out in the midnight. We were forced to pay for just for a visitor. Even General Manager of the hotel was supporting Front office manager. Either general Manager or Front office Manager were least bothered to apologize for their behaviour. We felt like we were in a budget small time hotel. Terrible and painful experience.",1,Ocean Palms Goa

Trust me its really hard to find the right location near to multiple tourist places. After spending a weeks time in searching hotels, I thought of going with honeymoon packages from vendors, but it would have cost me (40K) twice the amount I had spent on my entire journey (20K). Glad I booked in Oceans palm (4D/5N), the hotel is clean and spacious and very SAFE. The staff are very friendly, clean and humble. The restaurant of the hotel is way too cheaper than outside restaurants. There's gaming arena too (Carrom, table tennis, fouz ball, etc).

6995,"I stayed in this Hotel for 2 nights in a suite room with family and kids. You will not get feeling of being their guest. For every small thing staff will argue e.g I asked for additional key and staff stared arguing by saying that we issue only one key per room because guests don't return it, when I asked that how to manage if it is taken by one guest, they said we will open for you with master key but when I asked how power will work, they said power will not be there. With much request and assurance that you charge me extra money if I don't return both the keys, they issued me extra key. They charged me high over and above MMT charges because my second kid is 13+ claiming that they will provide extra service if kid is above 12 but they did not provide anything extra. Not sure what difference it made to them if kid is 1 year above 12 and why they charged extra. So called sofa-cum-bed is very uncomfortable even kids can't sleep in that.",3,Ocean Palms Goa

7074,"If there was a word to describe the stay it would be “disgusting”. I had booked a Suite Room for the long weekend in Aug for 4D/3N three months in advance. I have been enquiring with their reservation desk prior to booking as well as post-booking to rule out any advances and was told that the best rooms on offer were the suite rooms. On checking-in, the look and feel of the entire property itself were very dated. I had to park my own car in their tiny parking space already fully occupied by 2-3 more cars and no valet service available. On checking-in, on entering the so-called suite room, felt have entered an apartment 50 years old with dirty linen, old wooden furniture, and rusted balcony rails. To top it, the washroom was as tiny as you wouldn’t even imagine in a suite. House-keeping told the AC would take 15 mins to cool. Wow! Truly felt like a Maharaja for the entire experience. On confronting the hotel reception desk, was assured that they would shift us into another block the next day in so-called Suite Superior Rooms(Ironically the category of the room itself is not advertised on their website). It didn’t have any feeling of 4 star(as claimed by Hotel). The entire hotel had such a negative vibe had a difficult time spending the night there. I was sure to leave the place, inspite if being offered another room. Being a long weekend, reservations in another hotel were full but was lucky to find accommodation in nearby.",1,Ocean Palms Goa

Overall experience was good.",5,Ocean Palms Goa
7078,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days. I especially booked pool side room. The location of this room was good but the room was small and was room was very small. Hotel room service was good and appreciated. But the hotel gallery was a completely mess. Now when I entered into hotel 25 November at the reception, the reception guy started welcoming us in a harsh rude way and started explaining rules send regulations of hotel in a very rude manner. Which is totally not expected. Second thing is the worst behavior that I had seen of pool side attendant. He was so rude even after complaining, he was reacting in a same manner. If you don't want your pool to get used by anyone why the hell are you making it and taking so much money for the same. That guy behavior was pathetic. Overall experience is 2.5, hotel location is good, service is good, food is very good, pool management is worst, cleanliness is poor. Welcome was very poor, rooms were small in size. Please if you are taking so much money in the name of hospitality than at least give some service to your customers.",3,Ocean Palms Goa

Recreational facilities: Sports (e. G. TT, carrom etc), GYM, pool. 5. Complimentary Buffet breakfast. Cons: 1. Room door lock did not worked for us and it was later fixed, caused us inconvenience. At one moment room cleaning staff entered the room by using their master key without permission. Buckets/Mug was not provided by default, later provided on request. Drinking water was too costly (INR 24 - 750 ml) manufactured by hotel itself with the brand TAAN. Only 2 bottles was given complimentary. If you go for RO water it is given in used bottles and not in a JUG. Food (Dinner/Lunch) dish options are limited and for us it was too costly.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

Overall it is suited as average star hotel and not good star as there was no garden space, sports equipments were old and not maintained that well.

7283,"We stayed for 4 days in this resort. It was just family vacation and we enjoyed the indoor games, the greenish surrounding, evening live concert, breakfast food. Also the location of the hotel was easier accessible, if one would like to go Calangute, Baga, Anjuna, Vagator Beach or Aguada Fort. Except the dinner where the food option was bit less, it was value for money stay for us.",5,Ocean Palms Goa

7292,"We stayed in this hotel during Christmas. Being the peak season, the hotel was expensive compared to the facilities available here. The restaurant food and the buffet menu were average. The hotel staff was trying to do their best. The rooms are spacious but not equipped with modern facilities and not up to the mark. If you are looking for a little luxury, don't select this hotel. This is not at all a 4 star property. Most difficult part is that they don't have a travel desk. There are cabs available outside the hotel, but they will charge a lot and they have the monopoly. Overall location of the hotel is also not great.",5,Ocean Palms Goa

7298,"I love that Ocean Palms is located very near a beach that is clean, less crowded and with a host of activities to do. We could just walk there and have fun! There are great eating and shopping places easily accessible. I had a nice room in an idyllic location, nestled among green palm trees and the view was fabulous! Rooms were really spacious, and tastefully done up. The hotel staff was warm and courteous, the food excellent, and services awesome. A pretty little pool, a nice restaurant, and good room service- what else could one ask for? On the downside- the gym is not so great, and the restaurant tends to get too crowded especially at breakfast. I wish they had a better way of managing crowds as it is pretty annoying to keep waiting for a table and then find someone cutting the queue to get ahead. Apart from this, I had a really pleasant stay here, and can not wait to go back!",5,Ocean Palms Goa
7299,Hotel is good but service and cleanliness is poor,5,Ocean Palms Goa

7302," to 15th jan'21.Beeba M Singh . Group Traveller . Jan 16, 2021It was worth the money we paid. For a budget trip as a group, it was worth it. The location is very centric. Hotel food is shockingly good and far better than the local cafes of restaurants around. Very clean and hygienic experience, overall. The only downside is the parking. Parking area is a little tight, but otherwise, the stay was decent. The crowd in the hotel is decent too, families and all sorts of groups stay here.",5,Ocean Palms Goa

7306,"Stayed for 3 nights. Initially was surprised to see amenities are different than what is claimed by MakeMyTrip on site. But I was assured by MakeMyTrip for make up. Resolution awaited. Coming back to hotel, its ideally located between Candolim and Calangute. Well maintained property, having good facilities like swimming pool, spa and a restaurant that serves extremely good food. Bet on healthy breakfast, it's apt for any person with good choices on the buffet. Though food is little pricey to pocket but the quantity and quality is of very high standard. Staff are very well groomed and polite. I would certainly like to stay again and again. I was lucky to get a complimentary dinner on the last day from the hotel. Really loved the sweet gesture shown by Hotel Management. Appreciate.",5,Ocean Palms Goa

Had selected Palm suite and the same was very spacious, was staying with 2 kids and the room was really good the only let down was the view as I was expecting either a pool view or a City view but there was none.

7320,"I stayed for 3 days and can easily say it was an awesome stay. The food buffet is awesome and the staff is incredibly humble and assisted whenever required. also, I got a complimentary upgrade to a palm superior room. I had dinner in the restaurant and on complaining about taste they re prepared the dish and didn't charged also. I have stayed in many hotels in Goa but the quality inn is far superior and economical.",4,Ocean Palms Goa
7321,Stay in Ocean Palms was good and memorable. Facilities were really good and neatly maintained. Swimming pool was also well maintained.

7332,Not a value for money.,1,Ocean Palms Goa
7333,"Ocean Palms Hotel is a good and comfortable hotel. However, it is in no way as good as it's FOUR STAR status or the the price that it charges. It is more suitable for a three star status and its price should be 750/- to 1000/- lower than what it advertises on Makemytrip or directly. A number of claims that it makes turn out to be lower than expectations. For e. G. It is more than a kilometre and half from Calangute Beach (even by the shortest route through Candolim Beach) instead of 400 meters that it advertises, the pool is like a children's pool, the fittings in the bathroom are old and rusted etc. However, with a Three Star Rating and lower rates it would be very much the value for it's money.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

7492,In spite of repeated information about non availability of towels and napkins they have not provided it. And at the time of check out staff is treating it as misplaced by us and claiming for recovery of cost of it. Very rude behaviour at the time of check out.,4,Ocean Palms Goa
7493,"I had a terrible experience here. Nothing is good not at all a good hotel. In typical words it's a dharamshala. Starting with rooms too small, drainage poor, balcony view pathetic, food quality bad, buffet has no options, pool size way too small, location pathetic, room service horrible, ask them for something and you will get that after 25 minutes that too after 2 reminder calls, no basic amenities provided. Don't choose this as your stay location, it can spoil your trip to Goa, the way it did mine, and yes the staff is not cooperative and they can give you favor after making you wait for 20 minutes and pretend that they have to use all their powers and call the higher authority and what not, don't use WiFi. Actually you won't be able to because it doesn't have a speed.
All of the worst that you can imagine is here. Including a poor drainage system in which what you have done in basin would come to you in your bathing area.",1,Ocean Palms Goa

Rooms are spacious but do not take room whose balcony faced the back side rather preferred pool side as the view was good. They do not have somking zone and if you sit in the balcony or roaming around this property you will smell cigrate smoke. Staff are supportive. Food was bellow average and costly.

The facilities provided are quite adequate for the people stay in the hotel. The food served in the restaurant especially the fish are tastier.

Also the breakfast buffet was quite good with all different varieties served in 3 days.",5,Ocean Palms Goa
7547,"I stayed for 3 nights in Ocean palm and the experience wasn't pleasant at all !! The room cleaning was not good. There was frequent power loss and to top it, my access card key holder was not working every time I was returning back to my room. The staff was rude and told me to put in card 2-3 times in the holder and it will work which didn't help. But this wasn't enough as the worst was yet to come !! I lost my trouser from the room and I suspected the cleaning boy might have taken. When I reported the matter to reception and housekeeping, they didn't take it seriously at all. They were just idling around stating they checked cctv footage and laundry and found nothing. Next day I complained to their manager George Thomas. To my shock, he turned out to be most rude, most callous, most unconvincing of the staff lot. He said that they can't do much about it as they didn't find it. I told him it might be a case of theft, then he asked me to lodge FIR. I asked for the cctv footage to be seen. Suddenly his policies came up and he said as per policies we don't show cctv footage to customers. But he will show if I bring cops! I said why will I lodge FIR for a trouser! Probably he said so as he was sure I wasn't gonna go to cops for something like trouser. Later the pitch of his tone rose and so his temper too. This convinced me that they are trying to cover up the entire scene to avoid their reputation being tarnished. Had they showed me the cctv footage, I would have atleast got convinced. George was very irresponsible with the choice of the words he used to conversate and was least bothered about the fact that he was talking to a prospective customer. I walked out of the manager room totally unhappy and didn't find my trouser nor got any compensation. I would not recommend this hotel for stay, unless you want your things to be stolen or to be subjected to inappropriate behaviour.",2,Ocean Palms Goa
7548,"Easy check-in, supportive staff allowed us to stay additionally for a couple of hours for check-out. Helped us, as needed, for local sightseeing places. Nice location of the hotel, good ambience, recreation facilities need a makeover (they are in very bad condition)",5,Ocean Palms Goa

Ocean palms is an average stay. For the same price, you can get a much better stay. Only positive is they have a huge swimming pool and a place for recreation. Else the standard room that I stayed in was below average.",3,Ocean Palms Goa
7562,"Booked a Palm Suite, room was pretty good with 2 balconies. The second room didn't have any AC, this could be looked into by the hotel. The pool is very small and at times is very crowded and you dont feel like getting in. Parking space is limited and you need to keep the car keys at the gate security so they can move your vehicle here and there as required. Breakfast is excellent, location is excellent, very close to the beach, close to Aguada fort and about 12KMS from Panji. There are is a Udupi place close by in case you want quick service and want to have some food without the wait. The only issue we faced was the digital swipe key didn't work and we were provided with a usual key to get access to the room, not a problem but these are small things that eventually matter.

7630,We expect hotel to be proactive to it's customer and not reactive. Hotel room was clean but required follow up for daily cleaning. On last day for few hours of extended stay was charged half day room charges were as we had checked in late on first day which was not considered. Room access card was not working and required to reach reception every time for getting it unlocked rather hotel providing the service. Wifi was slow and was discontinued before check out time.

It is a wonderful property and I was amazed by the rooms allotted to us. These were very clean, spacious, pool facing with two balconies. Checkin was smooth and hassle free. Staff was courteous and ever helpful. What more can you ask for. If I did not have prior booking in Radisson then I would have definitely extended my stay here. Much better than Radisson in every context. Breakfast spread was good but they could do with more sitting space as we had to wait for 15 minutes on both days. Had dinner at the restaurant but the fish served tasted a bit rubbery. But even after that I would still recommend this lovely property to all. see you again soon.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

We got a upgrade to the suite room and it was really nice. The staff were too good and went the extra mile to make sure customers are happy. The restaurant in the hotel made some yummy food and the staff were helping us to choose the right dishes. Buffet breakfast was really good but the items were mostly repetitive. Housekeeping and room service was prompt. Overall a gem and it was a very happy vacation for us. I would surely go back to them the next time I visit Goa. The only downsides were that the property had very minimal parking space. There was some violence at the hotel probably the staff, which was scary. One day there was some foul odour in the room(due to the surrounding), however when we informed reception they swung into action and made sure we were fine and immediately fixed it. Room fresheners really helped.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

No support from the hotel staff either when we'd requested them to arrange ambulance upon bringing my injured friend to the hotel. Police was highly unresponsive too. Goa is far away from being safe. Average hotel, self acclaimed 4 star, more of a 3 star property. I'd booked 2 suites, which weren't like a suite either. Had the worst experience.",2,Ocean Palms Goa

7668,"A decent place to stay near Calangute. Lady manager at the reception is a really good person, very courteous. Hotel has a very small swimming pool, just for namesake. And they charge you extra for rooms with a pool view, which is not worth at all. While checking-out, we has a really bad experience as some of the hotel staff got into argument over some tattoo stains on bed sheet. There was a bald man with spectacles who started explaining the prices, guests and what all not. Firstly, we were not warned about that. Secondly, they wanted to charge us? 3000 for some cheap white bed sheet. It was such a low from a prominent hotel. However, when lady manager intervened, the problem got resolved in 10 seconds.

Located in Calangute at a stone's throw from the Beach, Ocean Palms offers the perfect getaway option. The rooms are self contained with a refrigerator, coffee/tea maker, television and locker.

7676,"I stayed at Ocean Palms for 3 nights. There were few things (good and bad) that stood out. Good: -The staff at the restaurant was extremely nice and friendly. -Food was good -Location is good The bad: I did make the management aware of the problems but saw no solution for it even after complaining. During first 2 days of my stay there was some maintenance or construction work in progress at the premises. Two of us could not sleep for a minute because of continuous noise of saw machine and wall banging. -The hotel offered free Wi-Fi but apparently our room was way too far for the Wi-Fi signal, I told the reception person that I'm not able to connect to Wi-Fi because the signal strength is too weak. And I was told 'Yes we know, but it is what it is for now' -The AC did not blow cold air, I told about that at the reception, I was told that someone will be right up to take a look at that, but no one showed up : -Shower curtain had mold at the bottom. -Bathroom layout is the worst I have ever seen. Altogether I think I paid a lot of money and had higher expectations than this. No Value for money what so ever. Very disappointed.",3,Ocean Palms Goa
7677,"Nice hotel, value for money. Got upgrade to suite room. Well-maintained swimming pool. Excellent location.

Hotel should take some measures like fumes etc. To tackle with mosquitos.. Rest everything is great...",4,Ocean Palms Goa
7678,I would recommend this for family and friends as an ideal place. There was a carnival theme arranged during the weekends which did keep us engaged in the evenings with food and music. Other facilities such indoor games might have been little more encouraging. Breakfast buffets are good but timely feedback and improving on them would be really helpful. Staff here are really co-operative and would always give good suggestions for any ideas related to trip/planning. Overall a good experience.,4,Ocean Palms Goa

Only free 2 bottles of 750 ml per day is not always enough and hence required buying of water bottles.",5,Ocean Palms Goa
7694,Needs more improvement to be a four star hotel. Breakfast needs to be improved with variety especially for guest staying for longer days. We found menu is same all the 5 days we stayed. Kids games and other equipment needs to be in working condition. Room facilities like Wi-Fi needs to be improved. Most of the days we didn't get proper Wi-Fi.,3,Ocean Palms Goa
7695,"Really awesome place to stay in Goa and that is close to Calnguate beach. Worth for every penny. Found exactly what expected. We stayed for 3 nights at Ocean Palms and overall, it was a pleasant stay. The location of the hotel is excellent. The beach is at walkable distance and the market area is just outside the hotel. There is a car rental shop too, opposite to the hotel. We were welcomed with a sweet-sour drink called Kokam sharbat. The check-in was fast and easy. We were provided wifi access codes for our devices and the wifi worked pretty well inside the room and within the hotel premises, except that we had to keep logging in frequently. The room was clean with all basic amenities like fridge, coffee maker, iron etc. The housekeeping too did a good job by cleaning the room well everyday. Coming to the complimentary breakfast, the spread was wide with a good mix of Indian and continental varieties. The taste however, needs to improve big time. The idli was dry and hard and the parathas were thin with almost no stuffing and flavour. We survived on cornflakes, bread and omelettes during our stay.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

7697,"The rooms were big and clean. We got the 4 complimentary beers only in one room out of the 3 booked by us. They said you didn't select the right option while booking. We paid the same amount so how come the right option was not selected. 2. The free upgrade that's promised during booking was not provided in any of the rooms booked by us. We were expecting at least one room to get free upgrade on the last day. 3. Staff was very polite. Specially Prasad from the breakfast section. He went above and beyond to provide excellent service. Always smiling person in the entire group. 4. Overall it was a pleasant stay.

I feel at the price we got, it was a nice place to stay. It has a small swimming pool and a recreational areas with indoor games as well. It is better if you get the rooms facing the pool.

7789,A very good hotel. Good staffs. Very good buffet breakfast. Rooms are neat but little small in size. Checking time at 2PM becomes very inconvenient for the people coming early in the morning because they rarely provide early check in. They should change check in time to 12Pm. I found reception person especially the guy who sits there in the evening as very rude and doesn't know how a hospitality business can be run. Most of the hotels these days provide kids food as complimentary but here they charge a hefty amount. Definitely they should work on it. Swimming pool is little small in size but I can say it's ok. Room service is really very very expensive. Seems like they want you to go out and have food not in the hotel.,4,Ocean Palms Goa

When complained the hotel said it's their regular practice to clean without any intimation to the guest. That was weird. Overall ambience was good.

The air hockey table was not functioning properly. We complained to the hotel management, but they did nothing. In the hotel pics this stuff is shown kept in a AC room, but in reality they have kept it in a open shady dirty place. A complete time waste.In some of the rooms, moisture is seeping in the walls. The staff argued with us a lot, before changing the room. The staff behaviour is terrible. They lack the basic manners of hospitality. Rooms lack basic amenities like, bathing kit, dental kit, etc. The staff at the reception and at the pool had misbehaved with us. When we complained about this to the duty manager, he kept defending his staff and didn't listen to us at all. They fined us, for a drop of oil that got spilled on the blanket cover in the room. The hotel is not so near to the calangute beach. One has to take a cab or taxi for the beach. The hotel’s complimentary bus service to the beach is not functional most of the times.

I called the hotel and mr. Amar was so kind to send someone ever to the bike rental shop and then the mechanic called me. This was really and above and beyond assistance. Thought I did not get into the pool- it was well maintained n clean. My mom loved the stay and I enjoyed the stay as well. We stayed there for 4 nights.

Pros: - Housekeeping service was awesome - Swimming Pool - Buffet breakfast - Staff Cons: I would have give 5 star but the incident with the Ocean palm taxi driver (Name: Ali Vehicle Number: Ga 03 k 4960) and his rude behaviour have reduced it to 4. Don't believe these taxi drivers who ask you for the local trips. This has been asking us whenever we are going out saying do you need taxi for local trip. One day we thought of hiring this guy and went for the north Goa trip for Rs 2000 (Without bill). In the start of the trip my wife fell ill we had to return back to the hotel, I think at max we travelled 15-20 KM. So we asked him as we didn't complete the trip is there a fare cut as my wife fell ill. He didn't agree for that and on top of that he mentioned 'tabhiyath teek hone ke baadh aajoo' (Come once you well and fit). Who is this guy to suggest us. And took whole 2000 Rs and put it on the pocket. All these things happened in the premises of the hotel. I think hotel management shouldn't entertain these kind of drivers and shouldn't allow them to talk to the customers directly on the trip. Advice to the people: Don't trust these drivers who ask you for the local trips.",4,Ocean Palms Goa

8250,"Good location for vasco da gama railway station and Baina beach.
This hotel is very near to railway station vasco da gama and main bus terminal is 5 min walking from hotel. This hotel is undergoing the some maintenance activity like painting etc. So, wasn't clean like other hotels. There is a mosque nearby, so you will get to hear azan. I shouldn't say too loudly but with a moderate sound. Baina beach is near (not next to hotel). You can either walk for 15 minutes or take a bus in front of your hotel this takes 5 minutes bus journey. While going from hotel to baina beach you can get in the bus as the bus stops if you show you hand even if that isn't a bus stop. But while returning you may have to get off boarded in the central bus station vasco and walk 5 min from there to hotel. Room was good and clean. Towels are there and water bottles provided but soaps were not there. Many restaurants are located near to the hotel. So there is no problem considering the fact that this hotel does not have any arrangement for food.",4,Hotel Royal Palace.
8251,Room was dirty but very large and spacious. Ac had only one button to control (on/off) so not easy to set the temperature.,4,Hotel Royal Palace.
8252,It is located near Vasco Da Gama railway station. Hotel is located on the 3rd floor of the building. Entrance doesn't sound like hotel. It is situated in South Goa and near the main market so you can have everything thing you want for eating and clothing purposes. But due to located in south its very far from North Goa. The charm of Goa is located in north. So my opinion is that don't book this hotel if you are coming to enjoy Goa. Always book your hotel in North Goa.,3,Hotel Royal Palace.

8815,"Even though we have informed the front desk and have kept do not disturb sign on the door, we were repeatedly disturbed 4 days in a row. I got fed up and complained to the front desk but still, there was no improvement for the first 4 days. It took 5 days for them to finally stop disturbing us. This is kind of ridiculous. For the hot water to work, we have to waste 2 buckets of water to flow and leave then the hot water kicks in. This is real bad as a lot of water is being wasted in order to use the hot water by the guests. In these days of water conservation, it feels sad that the hotel is advising to throw 2 buckets of water to get the water to heat up, they need to change the system. The bed mattress is average and so for 2 or 3 days it will be okay but for any longer stay it will not be fine as your back will start hurting. We stayed for 9 days and we did not have a good stay.",1,Hotel Campal

I booked a single room for 1400 rupees & they took extra money from us as I stayed in the room for more 3 hours which is 1500. I thought not going to this hotel again.

8852,"Yes, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel Campal. THE LOCATION - Near to Panjim Market. 2 to 2. 5 Km approx. We are on family tour of 2+1 only and hence came to Panjim Bus stand by Volvo Bus from Thane city. Reception should be well versed with area to guide tourist exact location and transport. THE SERVICE : Good as we didn't avail much as we were on visit different places of Goa during day and came for rest only. THE ROOM - deluxe was comfortable and clean but additional bed in room is like crowded area with furniture. FACILITIES : Hot water shower was good but broken tap irritated sometimes.

8864,"Bad bathrooms, average housekeeping, bad food. Things could have been much better in such a good location.",2,Hotel Campal
8865,"It was good, but the complementary? Breakfast was not that good and there were not many options. The place is close by from the casinos and the Panjim bus stop. The location of the hotel is advantage of the stay.",3,Hotel Campal
8866,Electrical sockets were left open and extremely dangerous for kids (photos attached). The hotel does not have a lift & we were given a room on the third floor and it was extremely inconvenient to carry all luggage three floors up & therefore for to the same issue we even gave up the idea of going in for a walk. Also the rooms & bathroom were not clean. Zero value for money,1,Hotel Campal
8867,The staff in the Hotel were friendly. The room and the premises were neatly maintained.,5,Hotel Campal
8868,"Breakfast not at all worth (surprise thing is they will offer pav bhaji as a break fast which is worst in taste).. Room service doesn't include any service. . The only good part is the location. Rooms are below average, Would not go again there for sure. Travel Desk people are very commercial don't take any vehicle from them even you can get vehicles near by with the best price and vehicle conditions also very poor doesn't have proper brake system also. ADVICE:- please don't we even think about this hotel even you get best deal with Make my trip. THINK WISE.",1,Hotel Campal
8869,"Learning from this experience- always choose pay at property option because if you don't like the room or if it doesn't match the description, you will not get any refund of the full payment. At Hotel Campal we had a terrible experience with stuffy smelly dusty rooms. Had booked their deluxe room for two nights (cannot imagine how the standard rooms will be if this is what they call deluxe room). I was trying to reach their customer service to request an early check in but there was no one picking up the call for almost whole day. Later in the eve I got sms asking what was the call for. So I requested the early check in and asked for the price. The amount was mentioned in the sms. We agreed and reached at the hotel at 2.30 Am. As soon as we entered the room, it felt like the room wasn't used for many months. When we questioned, we were given another room but it wasn't any different. When we complained of the dust, the staff started dusting and spraying air freshener in front of us. When asked for mineral water bottle, we were denied and were told to drink the water that was available in the room filled in the jug (god known since when). After an argument, we got the bottled water. Later when asked for iron box and ironing board, we were told there is no ironing board and Hotel staff arrogantly suggested spread the clothes on the bed to iron. We walked out of the place in 15 min as cannot risk falling sick sleeping in a dusty room with ac on. Negligent customer service. Online mentioned contact numbers to call for special requests/issues but none is available to answer. Since the payment was done in advance, we didn't get any refund. Got unreasonable explanations. Overall a big disappointment.",1,Hotel Campal

9076,"We had stayed in Goa Woodlands back and had liked it then. Happy to note that this hotel has maintained its standards over the last 4 years. there was some pavement construction going on 4 years back and unfortunately the same type of construction, with jack hammer drilling going on this time also. That was the only bad part. Food in range was excellent and reasonably priced. We had lunch there on 2 days. No regrets. The complimentary breakfast at 4 sea was a bit spar tan. Choice was minimal, and not in line with the overall great experience otherwise. They were also playing some bill wood racy tunes in the morning very unlike the atmosphere in the adjoining range. They need to improve this aspect please provide better breakfast.
The room had 3 good sized beds, and we were pleasantly surprised that they could offer this triple occupancy, without the need for extra temporary bed as in other places. This was the best part of the stay. The wardrobe is a bit old its doors do not move smoothly and its interiors need to be repainted. But it is spacious and clean.",5,Goa Woodlands Hotel

The hotel has a very nice restaurant serving all meals. Buffet breakfast is pretty low-key, but sufficient, with made-to-order omelettes. The hotel also has its own bakey outlet on the front side. Rooms are really large, clean & functional. AC, water heater worked very well in lour room. The daily cleaning / housekeeping in the rooms was also good, although there always were uncleared plates from room service lying in the passageways for hours & hours.

Overall value for money if you book with some offer. Bathroom is OK. Could be better. Facilities are basic. The city, railway station, market, eateries are at a walking distance from the hotel. This hotel is in south Goa. Quite far from the popular beaches and nightlife in North Goa. However the south Goa beaches are nice and clean. The hotel also has a vegetarian hotel along with a multi cuisine restaurant. This is known for these restaurants as much as the rooms. Overall decent experience. Nothing too great or bad. Prices keep changing a lot. Keep checking. There is support for free cancellation up to three days of the date. Colva beach is one of the nearest beaches from the hotel. However it is not at a walking distance. Around 6 km or so. See if you get better options and use this is as a good backup option. There are so many hotels in Goa. It is sometimes hard to decide on one. Keep looking and get the right deal. That is all I can think off at the moment. This is my review after a recent stay with family. The the. The.

9326,"If you are not a beach resort fanatic or water sport fan then this is the hotel for you. Located in the heart of Margao city, all modes of transport are easily accessible. The market is at a walking distance. The hotel has a pure vegetarian and a multi cuisine restaurant which should satisfy the finicky Indian Palate. The prices are a bit stiff but the food is good. Service is excellent and prompt at lunch and dinner service. However, the breakfast is disappointing and management appears to be biased towards its vegetarian customers. Although eggs are served to order, non-veg customers looking for a hearty American breakfast of sausages, ham and bacon will be sorely disappointed. When buffet service is provided, the waiters are unable to keep the tables well stocked and often will forget your order completely. Their grasp of the English language is not to an acceptable level. The rooms are spacious and the beds are large and generous. Linen top quality and crispy clean. The toiletries are adequate. Not much of a view from the rooms but is not to be expected in an old city based hotel. Here is the letdown - a) Room 410 and 411 where we initially checked in had severe infestation in the wooden panel of the ceiling. When housekeeping was called in, they didn't seem surprised and unerringly led us to rooms 311 and 310. I would nonetheless recommend this hotel for its value for money.",3,Goa Woodlands Hotel

Centralized AC is one of the best features in room. Coloring of walls, tiles in bathroom availability of power backups, lighting arrangement. King size balcony/window view to outside. Perfect for honey moon couples because breakfast is just awesome and the buffet set a you up for your whole day after a hectic night. I wish they had made one branch near clubs.

Breakfast with limited options but adequate with regard to taste and service. The closing time of 9. 30 am should be extended to 10. 30 am, which will be appreciated by many, I feel. Stepping out is into a normal Goan city with a nice garden, moderately priced eating establishments, and bus stops in all directions within a stone's throw away. Room was spacious, very good furniture, a fine central A. Toiletries provided as promised. Cleanliness is up to the mark. The restaurant, though a bit on the costlier side, provides excellent food, ambience, and service. Bar was not open due to current SC directive. Lift is the old grille type, and difficult to operate if both your hands are full, though you can airways ask one of the ever helpful staff to help you in that case.

9673,I booked this hotel for last day of my stay as I had to catch an early morning train from Madgaon. You can get good spacious rooms on the 4th floor for your family at very affordable price. The food menu is sufficiently good and pricing again is average. A good meal for 2 people will cost around 600 bucks. Do not expect a luxurious hotel with swimming pool as this is not a resort and this is located inside the town and can be classified as business hotel.

9712,"True value for money,outstanding hospitality and prompt service. I would love to visit again.",4,Goa Woodlands Hotel
9713,"We have been staying in Goa Woodlands for the past few years, mainly because of its location and spacious rooms. We love the big spacious rooms, big cots, the dining tables or sofa sets (depending on the room you get) etc. Room service food is quite good. Breakfast spread is average. Service was good except during the current stay, where we felt the staff were new and under training, so service levels were below average. But the last couple of visits, the staff were good and professional. Compared the rooms, the bathroom is quite small but functional. Their WiFi password and process for setting up WiFi is a nightmare and I don't understand why they should create such a complicated system for customers to get connected to WiFi. Free WiFi is almost a default requirement in the current age. Car parking is a major issue as they have no parking place. You can park on the road in front of the hotel, if that is not available, then you can park in the side corridor of the hotel campus, but leave the key at the reception - they have no trained valet and so no guarantee of your car getting handled properly - Mine did not get a good treatment this time. Overall, the spacious rooms are the major reason why we continue to choose this place again and again.",3,Goa Woodlands Hotel
