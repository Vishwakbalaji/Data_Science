# THE HOTEL REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

## Objective: Is to analyse the reviews from customer from different hotels to predict which hotel is best and gives full satisfaction to the customers.

## Approach: Starts from Web Scraping from a hotel booking websites, Cleaning the data, doing the pre-process using NLP and extract the Common Nouns alone, converting those nouns to Binaries, from that we doing Association Rule, from that considering the best support and confidence, Filtering the Max Support and removing the duplicates, then using the Compactness Pruning to consider the words between antecedents and consequents should be less than 3 are considered as compact and rest others are not compact and not compact are not considered, then again we are doing the Redundancy Pruning to check whether the single feature has Max p - support or not, if it has the max p support then we can consider those single words also are the feature. But still the process is going on...

## Process: The work is still going on (still finding the Opinion of customers from those features we selected is left and finally Sentiment Analysis)

## Outcome: To find the Sentiment analysis for those features that we are deriving from above.
