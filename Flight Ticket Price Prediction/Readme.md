# Flight Ticket Price Prediction

### Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable.
### And it is a Simple project to predict the price of the flight ticket based on the city

## Data Overview
Here each data point corresponds to trip of flight from one city to another.

- Airline: The name of the airline.

- Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey

- Source: The source from which the service begins.

- Destination: The destination where the service ends.

- Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.

- Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.

- Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.

* __Linear Regression__

* __Ridge Regression__

* __Lasso Regression__

* __K Neighbors Regressor__

* __Decision Tree Regressor__

* __Random Forest Regressor__

* __XGB Regressor__

## Performace Metric
- Since it is an regression problem we will use Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) and R-squared as regression metric.

## Final Output : XGB Regressor gave the ouput of RMSE: 0.133 and R-SQUARED: 0.93. This gives the highest value of all the other Regressor Model.
